# Instructions

Build a complete web application using static HTML files with backend functionality powered by Skapi.

# Requirements

## Backend Integration

Use the Skapi API to implement all backend features. Refer to the Skapi API documentation:
https://docs.skapi.com/skapi.md

The service ID is "ap22p3Z9NKH9CBNseFEc" and the owner ID is "f8e16604-69e4-451c-9d90-4410f801c006"

## Page Routing and Navigation

- Set the starting page as index.html.

- Ensure all form actions point to their correct destination pages so the app functions correctly when opened locally (e.g., via the file:// protocol).

## Authentication and Initialization

- Each HTML page must initialize the skapi-js library on load.

- Implement login state checks on each page.

- Redirect unauthenticated users when accessing restricted pages.

## Styling Guidelines

- Use a modern, material-style design.

- Ensure buttons and input elements are sized appropriately to match current UI standards.

- Use consistent box-sizing (e.g., border-box) to prevent layout issues, especially for elements with width: 100%.
