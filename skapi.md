# Getting Started

Welcome to Skapi! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started: creating a service, importing the Skapi library into your project, and establishing a connection between your application and the Skapi server.


## 1. Create a Service

1. Sign up for an account at [skapi.com](https://www.skapi.com/signup).
2. Log in and navigate to the [My Services](https://www.skapi.com/my-services) page.
3. Click on **Create New Service**

## 2. Initialize the Skapi Library

Skapi is compatible with both vanilla HTML and webpack-based projects (e.g., Vue, React, Angular, etc.).
You can import the library using a `<script>` tag or install it via npm.

### For HTML Projects

For vanilla HTML projects, import Skapi using a script tag and initialize the library.
For static HTML projects, ensure that the Skapi class is initialized in the HTML header on all pages. 

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/skapi-js@latest/dist/skapi.js"></script>
<script>
    const skapi = new Skapi('service_id', 'owner_id');
</script>
```

### For SPA Projects

To use Skapi in Single Page Application (SPA) projects such as Vue, React, or Angular, install skapi-js via npm.

```sh
$ npm i skapi-js
```

Then, import the library into your main JavaScript file:

```javascript
// main.js
import { Skapi } from 'skapi-js';
const skapi = new Skapi('service_id', 'owner_id');

export { skapi }

// You can now import skapi from anywhere in your project.
```

::: warning
Make sure to replace `'service_id'` and `'owner_id'` in `new Skapi()` with the actual values from your service.
:::


## 3. Get Connection Information

When your client has successfully connected to the Skapi server, you can use the [`getConnectionInfo()`](/api-reference/connection/README.md#getconnectioninfo) method to retrieve connection information.

::: code-group
```html [HTML]
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/skapi-js@latest/dist/skapi.js"></script>
<script>
    const skapi = new Skapi('service_id', 'owner_id');
</script>
<script>
skapi.getConnectionInfo().then(info => {
    console.log(info);
    /*
    Returns:
    {
        service_name: "Your Service Name",
        user_ip: "Connected user's IP address",
        user_agent: "Connected user agent",
        user_locale: "Connected user's country code",
        version: 'x.x.x' // Skapi library version
    }
    */
   window.alert(`Connected to ${info.service_name}`);
});
</script>
```

```javascript [SPA]
import { skapi } from '../location/of/your/main.js';
skapi.getConnectionInfo().then(info => {
    console.log(info);
    /*
    Returns:
    {
        service_name: "Your Service Name",
        user_ip: "Connected user's IP address",
        user_agent: "Connected user agent",
        user_locale: "Connected user's country code",
        version: 'x.x.x' // Skapi library version
    }
    */
   window.alert(`Connected to ${info.service_name}`);
});
```
:::<br><br>
# Working with HTML Forms

Skapi can handle HTML `onsubmit` events directly by passing the `SubmitEvent` as the first argument to Skapi methods.

Skapi's form handling simplifies the process of managing form submissions in web applications, allowing developers to easily process and send form data without manual handling.

In this example, we'll use the [`skapi.mock()`](/api-reference/connection/README.md#mock) method to send a request to the Skapi service and receive a response.

Here is an example of using a `<form>` with Skapi:

```html
<form onsubmit="skapi.mock(event).then(r => alert(r.hello)).catch(err => alert(err.message))">
  <input name="hello" placeholder="Say Hi">
  <input type="submit" value="Mock">
</form>
```

The above example is equivalent to the following code:

```html
<input id="hello" placeholder="Say Hi">
<button onclick="runMock()">Mock</button>
<script>
  async function runMock() {
    let helloMsg = document.getElementById("hello").value;

    try {
      let r = await skapi.mock({ hello: helloMsg });
      alert(r.hello);
    }
    catch (err) {
      alert(err.message);
    }
  }
</script>
```

As you can see, when a form submit event is passed as the first argument to a Skapi method, Skapi automatically converts your form input values into key-value JavaScript data. The input `name` becomes the key, and depending on the input type, the value corresponds to what the user has entered. 

## Nested Values and Arrays

You can create nested values and arrays by using the `[]` syntax in the `name` attribute.
The resolved data structure will depend on the input type.

When the key name inside the `[]` is a number, Skapi will resolve the value as an array.

```html
<form onsubmit="skapi.mock(event).then(r => console.log(r))">
    <input name="user[name]" placeholder="Name"><br>
    <input name="user[age]" type="number" placeholder="Age"><br>
    Skills:<br>
    <input name="user[skills]" type="radio" value="JavaScript"> JavaScript<br>
    <input name="user[skills]" type="radio" value="Python"> Python<br>
    IDE:<br>
    <input name="user[ide]" type="checkbox" value="Vim">Vim<br>
    <input name="user[ide]" type="checkbox" value="Emacs">Emacs<br>
    Check:
    <input name="check[]" type="checkbox">
    <input name="check[]" type="checkbox">
    <br>
    <input type="submit" value='Mock'>
</form>
```

The above example will resolve to the following structure:

```ts
{
  user: {
    name: string,
    age?: number,
    skills?: "JavaScript" | "Python",
    ide?: "Vim" | "Emacs" | <"Vim" | "Emacs">[]
  },
  check: boolean[]
}
```

As you can see, Skapi provides convenient form data handling by automatically structuring user input data based on the input type and the `name` attribute.

Number inputs are resolved as numbers, radio inputs are resolved as the selected value, and checkbox inputs are resolved as boolean values or strings if a value is specified.

When multiple inputs share the same name without using `[]` syntax, Skapi will attempt to convert the values into an array.


## Using Input Elements, Textarea, and Select Elements

Skapi can handle various input elements, including text, number, radio, checkbox, textarea, and select elements.

```html
<input name="my_message" id="message_input">
<button onclick="skapi.mock(document.getElementById('message_input'))
  .then(r => {
    alert(r.my_message);
  })">Mock</button>
```

In the example above, we use the `id` attribute to reference the input element and pass it directly to the Skapi method.

This approach is useful when you want to handle individual user input from a specific input element.


## Using the `action` Attribute in the `<form>` Element

When you specify a URL in the `action` attribute of a `<form>` element, the user will be redirected to that page upon a successful request.

On the destination page, you can use the [`skapi.getFormResponse()`](/api-reference/connection/README.md#getformresponse) method to retrieve the resolved data from the previous page.

The example below demonstrates how users can submit a form in `index.html` and then fetch the resolved data from the redirected page `welcome.html`.

For this example, create two HTML files in the same directory.

```
.
├─ index.html
└─ welcome.html
```

:::code-group
```html [index.html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/skapi-js@latest/dist/skapi.js"></script>
<script>
    // Replace 'service_id' and 'owner_id' with the appropriate values from your Skapi dashboard.
    const skapi = new Skapi('service_id', 'owner_id');
</script>

<form onsubmit="skapi.mock(event)" action="welcome.html">
  <input name="name">
  <input name="msg">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

```

```html [welcome.html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/skapi-js@latest/dist/skapi.js"></script>

<h1>Welcome <span id='your_name'></span></h1>
<p id='message'></p>

<script>
    // Replace 'service_id' and 'owner_id' with the appropriate values from your Skapi dashboard.
    const skapi = new Skapi('service_id', 'owner_id');
    
    skapi.getFormResponse()
      .then((r) => {
        // Resolved data from skapi.mock()
        your_name.innerText = r.name;
        message.innerText = r.msg;
      });
</script>
```
:::

::: tip
When building a static website, you can use the `action` attribute to redirect users to a new page after a successful request.

Each page should have the Skapi library imported and initialized.

In contrast, in a single-page application, it may not be necessary to redirect users to a new page.
:::<br><br># Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

It is a fundamental part of any application, as it allows users to control access to your application and its resources.

Authenticated users can have access to post data to your database, and also can have access to your custom APIs.

Skapi provides a full featured authentication system out of the box without the need for any additional configuration.

In this section, you will learn how to let users create an account, login, and logout from your service, or recover their account if they have forgotten their password.
<br><br>
# Creating an Account

To let users create a new account in your service, you can use the [`signup()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#signup) method. 

### Example: Creating an Account

::: code-group

```html [Form]
<form action='login.html' onsubmit="skapi.signup(event).catch(err=>alert(err.message))">
    <h2>Sign-Up</h2>
    <hr>
    <label>
        Email<br>
        <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="user@email.com" required>
    </label><br><br>
    <label>
        Password<br>
        <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Your password" required>
    </label><br><br>
    <label>
        Name<br>
        <input name="name" placeholder="Your name">
    </label><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Sign-Up">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
let parameters = {
  email: "user@email.com",
  password: "password", // Password must be between 6 and 60 characters.
  name: "User's name"
};

skapi.signup(parameters)
  .then(res => window.href = 'login.html')
  .catch(err => window.alert(err.message));
```

:::

The example above shows how to let users create their account in your service.
Once the user signup is successful, the user will be redirected to the login page.
The first argument takes the user's input (email, password, name) that will be used for signup.

::: warning
- If the user have not logged in to your service after account creation,
they will **NOT** appear on your user list in Skapi's admin page.

- If 7 days have passed since the account creation, and the user still have not logged in to your service,
user's signup will be automatically invalidated.
:::

## Login after Signup

The second argument takes additional options when creating an account.
You can also automatically login the user right after successful signup by setting `options.login` to `true` in options argument.

::: code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.signup(event, { login: true }).then(u=>alert('Hello ' + u.name))">
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="E-Mail" required><br>
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required><br>
    <input name="name" placeholder="Your name"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Create Account">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
let parameters = {
  email: "user@email.com",
  password: "password", // Password must be between 6 and 60 characters.
  name: "User's name"
};

let options = {
  login: true // If set to true, users will be automatically logged in after signup.
};

skapi.signup(parameters, options)
  .then(res => u=>alert('Hello ' + u.name));
```

:::

When the `options.login` is set to `true`, the method will return the [UserProfile](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#userprofile) object.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`signup()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#signup) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`signup(params, options?): Promise<UserProfile | string>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#signup)  

<br><br>
# Signup Confirmation

When an account is created with `options.signup_confirmation` set to `true` or URL string,
users will receive an email with the signup confirmation link.

The user must click on the confirmation link before logging into your service.
If the `options.signup_confirmation` value is a valid URL string,
the user will be redirected to that url after successful signup confirmation.

The URL string will work either with a full URL or relative path of your website.

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.signup(event, { signup_confirmation: '/path/to/your/success/page' })
    .then(r=> {
        // SUCCESS: The account has been created. User's signup confirmation is required.
        console.log(r);
    })">
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="E-Mail" required><br>
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required><br>
    <input name="name" placeholder="Your name"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Create Account">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
let parameters = {
  email: "user@email.com",
  password: "password",
  name: "User's name"
};

let options = {
  /** 
   * If set to true, the user will get a signup confirmation email with a confirmation link.
   * If set to a valid URL string, the user will be redirected to the url when the confirmation is successful.
   */
  signup_confirmation: '/path/to/your/success/page'
};

skapi.signup(parameters, options).then(res => {
    // "SUCCESS: The account has been created. User's signup confirmation is required."
    console.log(res);
});
```
:::

The example above shows how you can create a user account with the signup confirmation.

When the signup is successful, the user will get an email containing the confirmation link.
Once clicked, the user will be confirmed by your service and be redirected to the given URL.

If the `signup_confirmation` value was `true`,
the user will see 'Your signup has been successfully confirmed.' message in their blank web browser tab.

:::danger
When setting the `signup_confirmation` value to a relative URL path (e.g. `/relative/path.html`), it will not work if the website is not hosted.

It's because on local file systems your actual file url would be something like: `file:///C:/Users/username/Desktop/website/index.html`. And skapi does not collect folder informations of the user's local computer.

Set your redirect URL of `signup_confirmation` to be the full URL (e.g. `https://your.website.com/path/to/your/success/page`).
:::

You can also customize the email template for the signup confirmation email.

For more info on email templates, see [Automated E-Mail](/email/email-templates.md).

## Resending Signup Confirmation Email


If you need to resend the confirmation email, use the [`resendSignupConfirmation()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#resendsignupconfirmation) method. 

:::code-group
```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.login(event)
    .then(u=>console.log('Successfully logged in.'))
    .catch(err => {
        if(err.code === 'SIGNUP_CONFIRMATION_NEEDED') {
          if(confirm('Your signup confirmation is required. Resend confirmation email?')) {
            skapi.resendSignupConfirmation().then(res=>{
              console.log(res); // 'SUCCESS: Signup confirmation E-Mail has been sent.'
            });
          }
        }
        else throw err;
      }
    })">
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="E-Mail" required><br>
    <input id="password" type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.login({email: 'user@email.com', password: 'password'})
    .then(u=>console.log('Successfully logged in.'))
    .catch(err=>{
        /**
         * {
         *  code: 'SIGNUP_CONFIRMATION_NEEDED',
         *  message: "User's signup confirmation is required.",
         *  name: 'SkapiError'
         * }
         */
        
        if(err.code === 'SIGNUP_CONFIRMATION_NEEDED') {
            let sendConfirmation = window.confirm('Your signup confirmation is required. Resend confirmation email?');
            
            if(sendConfirmation) {
                // now you can resend signup confirmation E-Mail to user@email.com.
                skapi.resendSignupConfirmation().then(res=>{
                console.log(res); // 'SUCCESS: Signup confirmation E-Mail has been sent.'
                });
            }
        }

        else throw err;
    });
```
:::

In this example, the user tries to login and receives a `SIGNUP_CONFIRMATION_NEEDED` error.

Then, if the user chooses to, you can use the [`resendSignupConfirmation()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#resendsignupconfirmation) method to resend the confirmation email to the user's email address.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`resendSignupConfirmation()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#resendsignupconfirmation) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`resendSignupConfirmation(): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#resendsignupconfirmation)

::: warning
- To resend signup confirmation emails, the user must have at least one login attempt to your service.
- If the user fails to confirm within 7 days, their signup will be invalidated, and they will need to sign up again. 
:::

<br><br># Login / Logout

Once a user has signed up, they can log in to your service using their email and password.

## Login

Use the [`login()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#login) method to log a user into your service.

If the login is not successful due to invalid password, or user may not have confirm their signup etc... the [`login()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#login) method will throw an error.

When successful, it will respond with the [`UserProfile`](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#userprofile) object.

:::warning
If `signup_confirmation` option was set to `true` during [`signup()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#signup),
users will not be able to log in until they have confirmed their account.
:::

:::info
When the user has successfully confirmed their signup and logged in, they will be sent a welcome email.
You can also customize the email template for the signup confirmation email.

For more info on email templates, see [Automated E-Mail](/email/email-templates.md).
:::

Below is an example of a login form that uses the [`login()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#login) method.
When the user successfully logs in, they will be redirected to the `welcome.html` page.

::: code-group

```html [Form]
<form action='welcome.html' onsubmit="skapi.login(event).catch(err=>alert(err.message))">
    <h2>Login</h2>
    <hr>
    <label>
        Email<br>
        <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="user@email.com" required>
    </label><br><br>
    <label>
        Password<br>
        <input id="password" type="password" name="password" placeholder="Your password" required>
    </label><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
let parameters = {
  email: 'user@email.com',
  password: 'password'
}

skapi.login(parameters)
  .then(user => window.href = 'welcome.html');
```
:::

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`login()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#login) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`login(params): Promise<UserProfile>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#login)

## Requesting User Information

The [`getProfile()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#getprofile) method allows you to retrieve the user's information via promise method.
It returns the [UserProfile](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#userprofile) object.

If the user is not logged in, [`getProfile()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#getprofile) returns `null`.

This method is particularly useful for determining the user's authentication state when they first visit or reload your website.

```js
skapi.getProfile().then(profile=>{
  console.log(profile); // User's information

  if(profile === null) {
    // The user is not logged in
  }
})
```

You can also refresh the auth token and fetch the updated profile by passing `options.refreshToken` to `true`.

```js
skapi.getProfile({ refreshToken: true }).then(profile=>{
  console.log(profile); // Updated user's information

  if(profile === null) {
    // The user is not logged in
  }
})
```

This can be useful when the user needs to get their updated profile when it's updated from another device, or admin might have made change to the users profile, or you just want your users to update their token for some other security reasons.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`getProfile()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#getprofile) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getProfile(options?): Promise<UserProfile | null>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#getprofile)


## Auto Login

By default, once user login to your website, their login session is maintained until they logout.

To ensure that users' sessions are destroyed when they leave your website, you can set options.autoLogin to false in the third argument when initializing Skapi.

```javascript
const options = {
  autoLogin: false, // set to true to maintain the user's session
};

//Set the third argument as options
const skapi = new Skapi('service_id', 'owner_id', options);
```

## Listening to Login Status

You can listen to the login status of the user by setting a callback function in the `option.eventListener.onLogin` option argument of the constructor argument in Skapi.

The `onLogin` callback function will be triggered in the following scenarios: when the webpage loads and the Skapi instance is initialized with the user's current authentication state, when a user logs in or logs out, and when their profile information is updated.

The callback function will receive the [UserProfile](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#userprofile) object as an argument.
```js
const options = {
  eventListener: {
    onLogin: (profile) => {
      console.log(profile); // is null when user is logged out, User's information object when logged in.
    }
  }
};

const skapi = new Skapi('service_id', 'owner_id', options);
```

You can also add multiple event listeners to the `onLogin` event after the Skapi object has been initialized.

```js
skapi.onLogin = (profile) => {
  console.log(profile); // null when user is logged out, User's information object when logged in.
}
```

This handler can be useful for updating the UI when the user logs in or logs out.


## Logout

The [`logout()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#logout) method logs the user out from the service.

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit='skapi.logout(event)' action='page_to_show_after_logout.html'>
  <input type='submit' value='Logout'>
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.logout().then(res=>{
  console.log(res); // 'SUCCESS: The user has been logged out.'
  window.location.replace("page_to_show_after_logout.html");
});
```
:::


## Global Logout

You can let the users logout and invalidate all tokens across all the users devices by setting `params.global` to `true`.

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit='skapi.logout(event)' action='page_to_show_after_logout.html'>
  <input type='checkbox' name='global' checked>
  <input type='submit' value='Logout'>
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.logout({global: true}).then(res=>{
  console.log(res); // 'SUCCESS: The user has been logged out.'
  window.location.replace("page_to_show_after_logout.html");
});
```
:::


For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`logout()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#logout) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`logout(params?): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#logout)
<br><br>
# Forgot password

When the user forgets their password, they can request a verification code to reset their password.

:::warning
If the user's email is not verified, they will not be able to receive a verification code and may lose access to their account permanently.

It is recommended to encourage users to verify their email addresses.
For more info on email verification, see [Email Verification](/user-account/email-verification.md).
:::

## Step 1: Request Verification Code

Use the [`forgotPassword()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#forgotpassword) method to request a verification code.

In this example, the [`forgotPassword()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#forgotpassword) method is called with the user's email as a parameter.

The user will receive an email containing a verification code that they can use to reset their password.

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.forgotPassword(event).then(res => {
    console.log(res) // SUCCESS: Verification code has been sent.
})">
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="E-Mail" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Request Verification Code">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.forgotPassword({email: 'someone@gmail.com'}).then(res=>{
  // User receives an e-mail with a verification code.
  // SUCCESS: Verification code has been sent.
  console.log(res);
});

```
:::

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`forgotPassword()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#forgotpassword) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`forgotPassword(params): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#forgotpassword)

::: info
Due to security reasons, [`forgotPassword()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#forgotpassword) will not tell the user whether the email exists.
:::

You can also customize the email template for the verification email.

For more info on email templates, see [E-Mail Templates](/email/email-templates.md).

## Step 2: Reset Password

The user will receive an email containing a verification code. After the user receives the verification code, they can use the [`resetPassword()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#resetpassword) method to reset their password.

The [`resetPassword()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#resetpassword) method is called with the user's email, the verification code received via email, and the new password.

Upon successful password reset, the user's account password will be set to the new password provided.

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.resetPassword(event).then(res => {
    console.log(res); // SUCCESS: New password has been set.
})">
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="E-Mail" required><br>
    <input type="text" name="code" placeholder="Verification Code" required><br>
    <input type="password" name="new_password" placeholder="New Password" required><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Change Password">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.resetPassword({
  email: 'someone@gmail.com', 
  code: '123456', // code sent to user's registered email address
  new_password: 'new_password' // The password should be at least 6 characters and 60 characters maximum.
}).then(res => {
  console.log(res);
  // SUCCESS: New password has been set.
});
```

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`resetPassword()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#resetpassword) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`resetPassword(params): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#resetpassword)<br><br># OpenID Login

Skapi provides support for OpenID authentication profiles.

## What is OpenID?

OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to be authenticated by relying on a third-party service, called an OpenID provider, without needing to have a separate identity and password for each service. This simplifies the login process for users and enhances security by reducing the number of passwords that need to be managed.

With OpenID, users can log in to multiple websites using a single set of credentials from an OpenID provider such as Google, Facebook, or other identity providers. This process involves redirecting the user to the OpenID provider's login page, where they authenticate themselves, and then returning to the original website with a token that confirms their identity.

## Login with OpenID Profile

If you have access to an OpenID provider's API, you can register your OpenID logger from your Skapi service page.

Although OpenID providers have different authentication methods, the general process follows these steps:

1. Register an OpenID logger in Skapi
2. Redirect the user to the OpenID provider's login page
3. Redirect the authenticated user back to your webpage
4. Retrieve the access token to call [`openidLogin()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#openidlogin)
5. The user will be logged into your Skapi application

## Google OAuth Example

In this example, we'll demonstrate implementing Google OAuth authentication.

### 1. Set Up Google OAuth Service

Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create your OAuth service.

Follow their [instructions](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849?hl=en). Make sure to set up the correct redirect URL that points to your web application.

### 2. Register Your OpenID Logger in Skapi

1. Log in to [skapi.com](https://www.skapi.com).
2. Click on the service where you want to register your OpenID Logger.
3. From the side menu, click on **OpenID Logger**.
4. Click **Register Logger**.
5. Set up the *Logger ID*. This is an identifier used when calling [`openidLogin()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#openidlogin). You can use any name, but for this example, set it to **google**.
6. Set up the request URL to the Google API where you can retrieve the user's profile. Set it to `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo`.
7. Set up the *Username Key*. This should be an OpenID attribute name that holds a unique identifier. For this example, set it to **email**.
8. Set up the request headers as shown below:
    ```
    {
        "Authorization": "Bearer $TOKEN"
    }
    ```
9. Click **Save**.


### 3. Register Client Secret Key

When retrieving an access token for Google OAuth, the Google API requires a client secret key.

Since the client secret key should not be exposed, register the client secret key of your OAuth service in Skapi.

1. In the service page, click on the **Client Secret Key** menu.
2. Click on **Register Client Secret Key**.
3. Give a name to your secret key. You can use any name, but for this example, set it to **ggltoken**.
4. Enter the client secret key you obtained from your Google OAuth service.
5. Click the checkmark to save.

### 4. Set Up Link to Google Login

Create a link URL and button for the Google OAuth login page.

```html
<button onclick='googleLogin()'>Google Login</button>
<script>
    const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "1234567890123-your.google.client.id"; // Replace this with your actual client ID
    const REDIRECT_URL = window.location.href.split('?')[0]; // Current URL to redirect back from Google login page

    function googleLogin() {
        let rnd = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2); // Generate a random string

        // Build link to login page
        let url = 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth';
        url += '?client_id=' + GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID;
        url += '&redirect_uri=' + encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URL);
        url += '&response_type=code';
        url += '&scope=' + encodeURIComponent('https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email');
        url += '&prompt=consent';
        url += '&state=' + encodeURIComponent(rnd);
        url += '&access_type=offline';

        // Redirect user to the URL
        window.location.href = url;
    }
</script>
```

### 5. Set Up Access Token Retrieval

When the user is authenticated and redirected back to your web application, use [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-bridge/client-secret-request) to retrieve the access token. You need to add code that runs when the user is redirected back from the Google login page.

Once the access token is fetched, you can call [`openidLogin(event?:SubmitEvent | params): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#openidlogin) to log your users into your web application.

```html
<button onclick='googleLogin()'>Google Login</button>
<script>
    const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "1234567890123-your.google.client.id"; // Replace this with your actual client ID
    const REDIRECT_URL = window.location.href.split('?')[0]; // Current URL to redirect back from Google login page

    function googleLogin() {
        let rnd = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2); // Generate a random string

        // Build link to login page
        let url = 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth';
        url += '?client_id=' + GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID;
        url += '&redirect_uri=' + encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URL);
        url += '&response_type=code';
        url += '&scope=' + encodeURIComponent('https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email');
        url += '&prompt=consent';
        url += '&state=' + encodeURIComponent(rnd);
        url += '&access_type=offline';

        // Redirect user to the URL
        window.location.href = url;
    }

    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

    if (urlParams.get('code')) { // When the webpage is loaded, check if it's redirected from the Google login page.
        (async ()=>{
            // Safely retrieve access token using clientSecretRequest
            const data = await skapi.clientSecretRequest({
                clientSecretName: "ggltoken",
                url: 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token',
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                },
                data: {
                    code: code,
                    client_id: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
                    client_secret: "$CLIENT_SECRET",
                    redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URL,
                    grant_type: 'authorization_code'
                }
            });

            if (data.error) {
                console.error(data);
                throw data
            }

            // Use openIdLogin to log in
            await skapi.openIdLogin({ id: 'google', token: data.access_token });
            window.location.href = '/';
        })()
    }
</script>
```

:::warning
For this Google OAuth example, we use [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-bridge/client-secret-request) to request an access token with a secured client secret key, and [`openidLogin()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#openidlogin) to actually sign up/log in the user to your service using the obtained access token.

Be sure to set up both Client Secret Keys and OpenID Loggers, and use the clientSecretName and OpenID Logger ID to securely make requests from the frontend.

### [`openidLogin(event?:SubmitEvent | params): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#openidlogin)<br><br># User's Account

When a user creates an account in your service, user's can access and manage their account information.

In this section, you will learn how to let users verify their email, change their password, update their profile, and remove their account from your service.<br><br># E-Mail Verification

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method
:::

User with verified E-Mail can:

- Reset their password if they've forgotten it.
- Receive newsletter from the service owner if they choose to.
- Recover their disabled account.
- Allow their email address to be public to other users if they choose.

You can verify your user's email address with [`verifyEmail()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#verifyemail).

:::tip
The user's email is automatically verified if [signup confirmation](/authentication/signup-confirmation.md) was requested in [`signup()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#signup).
:::

The example below shows how you can verify your users email address.

1. The first method call, without any arguments, sends a verification email to the user.
2. The second call completes the verification process by passing the verification code that user retrieved from their email.

``` js
  // Send verification code to user's E-Mail
  skapi.verifyEmail().then(res=>{
     // 'SUCCESS: Verification code has been sent.'
    console.log(res);

    // Prompt user to enter the verification code
    let code = prompt('Enter the verification code sent to your E-Mail');
    
    // Verify E-Mail with the code
    skapi.verifyEmail({ code }).then(res=>{
      // SUCCESS: "email" is verified.
      window.alert('Your email is verified');
    });
  });
```

please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`disableAccount(): Promise(string)`](/api-reference/user/README.md#disableaccount)

## Recovering a Disabled Account

Disabled accounts can be reactivated **within 90 days** using the [`recoverAccount()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#recoveraccount) method. This method allows users to reactivate their disabled accounts under the following conditions:

- The account email must be verified.
- The [`recoverAccount()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#recoveraccount) method must be called from the `catch` block of a failed [`login()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#login) attempt using the disabled account.

The [`recoverAccount()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#recoveraccount) method sends an email to the account owner, containing a confirmation link (The same signup confirmation email) for account recovery.

Additionally, you can provide an optional `string` argument to the [`recoverAccount()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#recoveraccount) method, which will redirect the user to the specified URL or relative path of your website upon successful account recovery.

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.login(event)
    .then(u=>console.log('Login success.'))
    .catch(err=>{
        console.log(err.code); // USER_IS_DISABLED
        if(err.code === 'USER_IS_DISABLED') {
          // Send a recovery email to the user with a link.
          // When the user click on the link, the user will be redirected when account recovery is successful.

          let recover = confirm('Do you want to recover your account?')
          if(recover) {
            skapi.recoverAccount('/welcome/back/page').then(res=>{

```

```js [JS]
// user attempt to login
skapi.login({email: 'user@email.com', password: 'password'})
    .then(u=>console.log('Login success.'))
    .catch(err=>{
        console.log(err.code); // USER_IS_DISABLED
        if(err.code === 'USER_IS_DISABLED') {
            // Send a recovery email to the user with a link.
            // When the user click on the link, the user will be redirected when account recovery is successful.

            let recover = window.confirm('Do you want to recover your account?')
            if(recover) {
            skapi.recoverAccount("/welcome/back/page").then(res=>{

            });
            }
        }
    });
```

:::

In the example above, the [`recoverAccount()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#recoveraccount) method is called from the catch block of a failed login attempt using a disabled account.

If the login attempt fails with the error code `"USER_IS_DISABLED"`, user can choose to recover their account.

The [`recoverAccount()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#recoveraccount) method is called to send a recovery email to the user.
The recovery email contains a link, and when the user clicks on the link, they will be redirected to the relative path of the website URL: `/welcome/back/page` upon successful account recovery.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`recoverAccount()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#recoveraccount) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`recoverAccount(redirect: boolean | string): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/user/README.md#recoveraccount)
 
:::danger
User should know their password, and have their account email verified.
Otherwise user's account cannot be recovered.

<br><br># Search Users

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method
:::


Users can search, retrieve information of other users in your service using the [`getUsers()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#getusers) method. By default, [`getUsers()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#getusers) will return all users chronologically from the most recent sign-up.

User information retrieved from the database is returned as a list of [UserPublic](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#userpublic) objects.

:::info
Any attribute that is not set to public will not be retrieved.
:::


```js
skapi.getUsers().then(u=>{
  console.log(u.list); // List of all users in your service, sorted by most recent sign-up date.
});
```

In the example above, the [`getUsers()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#getusers) method is called without any parameters.
This retrieves a list of all user profiles in your service.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`getUsers()`](/api-reference/user/README.md#getusers) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getUsers(params?, fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<UserPublic>>`](/api-reference/user/README.md#getusers)

## Searching users with conditions

Following examples shows how you can search users based on attributes such as name, timestamp (account created timestamp), birthdate... etc

#### Search for users whose name starts with 'Baksa'

```js
let params = {
  searchFor: 'name',
  condition: '>=', // >= means greater or equal to given value. But on string value, it works as 'starts with' condition.
  value: 'Baksa'
}

skapi.getUsers(params).then(u=>{
  console.log(u.list); // List of users whose name starts with 'Baksa'
});
```

#### Search for users who joined before 2023 Jan 1

```js
let timestampParams = {
  searchFor: 'timestamp',
  condition: '<', // Less than given value
  value: 1672498800000 //2023 Jan 1
}

skapi.getUsers(timestampParams).then(u=>{
  console.log(u.list); // List of users who joined before 2023 jan 1
});
```

#### Search for users whose birthday is between 1985 ~ 1990

```js
let birthdateParams = {
  searchFor: 'birthdate',
  value: '1985-01-01',
  range: '1990-12-31' // Queries range of value from given value to given range value.
}

skapi.getUsers(birthdateParams).then(u=>{
  console.log(u.list); // List of users whose birthday is between 1985 ~ 1990
});
```

The `searchFor` parameter specifies the attribute to search for, and the value parameter specifies the search value.

#### The following attributes can be used in `searchFor` to search for users:

- `user_id`: unique user identifier, string
- `email`: user's email address, string
- `phone_number`: user's phone number, string
- `name`: user's profile name, string
- `address`: user's physical address, string
- `gender`: user's gender, string
- `birthdate`: user's birthdate in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, string
- `locale`: the user's locale, a string representing the country code (e.g "US" for United States).
- `subscribers`: number of subscribers the user has, number
- `timestamp`: timestamp of user's sign-up, number(13 digit unix time)
- `approved`: search by account approval status, object: ```{ by: 'admin' | 'skapi' | 'master'; approved?: boolean }```


#### The `condition` parameter allows you to set the search condition.

- `>`: Greater than the given value.
- `>=`: Greater or equal to the given value. When the value is `string`, it works as 'starts with' condition.
- `=`: Equal to the given value. (default)
- `<`: Lesser than the given value.
- `<=`: Lesser or equal to the given value.

When searching for a `string` attribute, `>` and `<` will search for strings that are higher or lower in the lexicographical order, respectively. And `>=` operator works as 'start with' condition.

:::info
- Conditional query does not work on `user_id`, `email`, `phone_number`, `approved`. It must be searched with the '=' condition.
- Users cannot search for attributes that are not set to public.
:::


The `range` parameter enables searching for users based on a specific attribute value within a given range. For example, if searching by `timestamp` with a range of 1651748526 to 1651143726, only users created between the two timestamps will be returned. 

:::warning
The `range` parameter cannot be used with the `condition` parameter.

Skapi provides fast, simple, secure, yet flexible way to store, retrieve data from your database.

You can start storing any data from small json data to large binary files up to 5tb per file while Skapi handles the security, indexing, and file storage for you.

Files will be served through the CDN, and will have restricted access based on the access group the uploader has set.

Mind you, Skapi database has completely different approach to database management compared to traditional databases.

We designed the database to be User-Centric, meaning that the end-users(frontend) are the one configuring the database schema and security for you.

By this approach, the database does not require any complex setup, or schema definition that cost time and money just to get things started.

In this section, you will learn how to store and retrieve data from your database, and learn how Skapi's powerful indexing system can help you search your data.<br><br># Creating a Record

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method
:::

Users can create [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) method to create a new record or update existing records in the database.

It takes two arguments:

- `data` The data to be saved in key-value pairs. It can be an object literal, `null`, `undefined` or a form `SubmitEvent`.
- `config` (required): Configuration for the record to be uploaded. This is where you specify the table name, access group, index values, etc.

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.postRecord(event, { table: 'my_collection'}).then(record => console.log(record))">
    <input name="something" placeholder="Say something"/>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

```js [JS]
// Data to be saved in key:value pairs
let data = {
    something: "Hello World"
}

// Configuration for the record to be uploaded
let config = {
    table: 'my_collection'
}

skapi.postRecord(data, config).then(record=>{
    console.log(record);
    /*
    Returns:
    {
        data: { something: "Hello World" },
        table: { name: 'my_collection', access_group: 'public' },
        ...
    }
    */
});
```
:::

This example demonstrates using the [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) method to create a record in the database.
When the request is successful, the [RecordData](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#recorddata) is returned.

In this example, the first argument takes the actual data to be uploaded to the database.
The data is a Javascript object that has string value in the key 'something'.
And in the second argument we have set table name to be `my_collection`.

Table name is a required field in the configuration object and the table name should not contain any special characters.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`postRecord(data, config):Promise<RecordData>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord)

:::tip Note
Skapi database does not require you to pre-setup your database schema.

If the specified table does not exist, it will be automatically created when you create the record.
Conversely, if a table has no records, it will be automatically deleted.
:::<br><br># Fetching Records

The [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method allows you to fetch records from the database. It retrieves records based on the specified query parameters and returns a promise that resolves to the [DatabaseResponse](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#databaseresponse) containing the [RecordData](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#recorddata) object.

It takes two arguments:
- `query`: Specifies the query parameters for fetching records.
- `fetchOptions`: (optional)
    Specifies additional configuration options for fetching database records
    For more information, see [Database Fetch Options](/database/fetch.md#database-fetch-options).

### Fetching Records from a Table

```js
let query = {
    table: 'my_collection'
}

skapi.getRecords(query).then(response=>{
    // response
    /**
     * endOfList: true,
     * list: [
     *  ...
     * ],
     * startKey: 'end',
     * ...
     */
});
```

The example above retrieve records from a table named 'my_collection'.
The `table` parameter in the `query` argument sets the table name you want to fetch records from.
The retrieved records are accessed through the `response.list` property.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getRecords(query, fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<RecordData>>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords)

### Fetching Record by ID

You can fetch a record by its unique ID using the [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method. When fetching a record by ID, you don't need to provide any additional configuration parameters.

```js
let query = {
    record_id: 'record_id_to_fetch'
};

skapi.getRecords(query).then(response => {
    // response
    /**
     * endOfList: true,
     * list: [{
     *  ... // only 1 result
     * }],
     * startKey: null // startKey is null as no more records can be retrieved
     */
});
```

In this example, the `query` object includes the `record_id` property set to the ID of the record you want to fetch.
`record_id` is a unique identifier for each record in the database.

The `response.list` will contain the record data if the record exists.


## Database Fetch Options

[FetchOptions](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#fetchoptions) can control the number of the record per fetch, fetching the next batch of records, fetching the records by ascending/descending order... etc.

This is used globally for all database related methods that allows optional [FetchOptions](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#fetchoptions) argument.

See full list of parameters: [FetchOptions](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#fetchoptions)


#### Limit Results with `fetchOptions.limit`

By default, 50 sets of the data will be fetched per call.
You can adjust the limit to your preference, allowing up to **1000 sets of data**, by using the `limit` key.

#### Fetch More Results with `fetchOptions.fetchMore`

To fetch the next batch of results, you can set the `fetchOption.fetchMore` to `true`.
When set to `false`(default), database will always return the first batch of the data.

This allows you to retrieve results in batches until the end of the list is reached.

#### Order results with `fetchOptions.ascending`

By default, the database fetch the data in ascending order.
If set to `false`, list of data can be fetched in descending order

For example, let's say there is millions of record in the database table 'my_collection'.
We can fetch the first 100 data, then paginate to the next 100 data by setting `fetchOptions.fetchMore` to `true`.

``` js
let query = {
    table: 'my_collection'
}

let fetchOptions = {
  limit: 100, // Limit each fetch to 100 data.
  fetchMore: false, // When false, database always gives you the first batch of data.
  ascending: false // Fetch in decending order.
}

skapi.getRecords(query, fetchOptions).then(res=>{
  console.log(res.list); // List of up to 100 data in the database.
  
  if(!res.endOfList) {
    // If there is more data to fetch, and if user chooses to, they can retrieve the next batch of 100.

    fetchOptions.fetchMore = true;
    if(confirm('Fetch more records?')) {
        skapi.getUsers(query, fetchOptions)
            .then(res=>{
                console.log(res.list); // List of the next 100 data from the database.
            }
        );
    }
  }
});
```

In this example, after the first call to the database, we see the `endOfList` value is not `true`.
This means there are more data left to fetch in the database.

To fetch more data in the database, we set `fetchOptions.fetchMore` to `true` and call the method again.
This allows to fetch the next batch of 100 data on each execution until the end of the list is reached.

:::tip
When using the `fetchMore` parameter, you must check if the response's `endOfList` value is `true` before making the next call.
The database will always return an empty list if the `fetchOptions.fetchMore` is set to `true` and it had reached the end of list and.

You can however, initialize your fetch and refetch from start by toggling `fetchOptions.fetchMore` back to `false`.
:::

:::tip
You can fetch all the data at once by recursively calling the method until the `endOfList` value is `true`.
However for efficiency, avoid trying to fetch all the data at once. Fetch only data the user needs and paginate when necessary.
:::<br><br># Unique ID

When uploading a record with [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord), you can set a unique ID for the record. This unique ID can be used to fetch the record later.
Unique ID must be a string and must be unique across all records in the table.

This feature is useful when you want to create a record with a unique identifier, such as a order ID, or any other unique identifier.

Unique ID can be used to fetch the record using the [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method.

Unique ID can be also used when fetching references of a record.
More on referencing can be found [here](/database/referencing.md).

## Creating a Record with Unique ID

```js
let data = {
    myData: "This is a record with a unique ID"
};

let config = {
    table: 'my_table',
    unique_id: 'My Unique ID %$#@'
};

skapi.postRecord(data, config).then(record => {
    console.log(record);
    /*
    Returns:
    {
        data: { myData: "This is a record with a unique ID" },
        table: { name: 'my_table', access_group: 'public' },
        unique_id: 'My Unique ID %$#@',
        ...
    }
    */
});
```

The example above demonstrates uploading a record with a unique ID.
When the request is successful, the [RecordData](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#recorddata) is returned.

## Fetching a Record with Unique ID

After uploading the record, you can fetch the record using the unique ID with [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method.

```js
let params = {
    unique_id: 'My Unique ID %$#@'
};

skapi.getRecords(params).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list);  // record with the unique ID
});
```

## Fetching Unique ID List

By using [`getUniqueId()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getuniqueid) method, you can fetch list of unique ID's that are registered in your database.

Below is an example where you can fetch list of unique ID that starts with **"guitar_"**

```js
let params = {
    unique_id: 'guitar_',
    condition: '>='
};

skapi.getUniqueId(params).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list);  // [{unique_id: "...", record_id: "..."}, ...]
});
```<br><br>
# Access Restrictions

Skapi database allows you to set access restrictions to records. This allows you to control who can access your records.

You can add additional settings to your `table` parameter using an `object` instead of a `string` in your `config.table`.
This allows you to set access restrictions to records using the `access_group` parameter.

The following values can be set for `table.access_group`:

- `private`: Only the uploader of the record will have access.
- `public`: The record will be accessible to everyone.
- `authorized`: The record will only be accessible to users who are logged into your service.
- `admin`: Only admin can use this group. The record will only be accessible to the admin of your service.

If `access_group` is not set, the default value is `public`.

::: tip
Unless the user is referencing a private access granted record, the user cannot upload a record with `access_group` set to higher level than their own access level.

You can read more about referencing records [here](/database/referencing.md).
:::

## Creating Record With Access Restrictions

Here's an example that demonstrates uploading record with `authorized` level access:

```js
let data = {
    myData: "Only for authorized users"
};

let config = {
    table: {
        name: 'ForAuthorizedUsers',
        access_group: 'authorized'
    }
};

skapi.postRecord(data, config).then(record => {
    console.log(record); // Only the logged users will have access this record.
});
```


## Fetching Records with Access Restrictions

In order to fetch records with `access_group` that is not `public`, you need to specify the `access_group` you are trying to fetch from. In this example, we are trying to fetch records from the "ForAuthorizedUsers" table with `authorized` access.

```js
let config = {
    table: {
        name: 'ForAuthorizedUsers',
        access_group: 'authorized'
    }
};

skapi.getRecords(config)
    .then(response => {
        // response
        /**
         * endOfList: true,
         * list: [
         *  {
         *      data: { myData: "Only for authorized users" },
         *      table: { name: 'ForAuthorizedUsers', access_group: 'authorized' },
         *      ...
         *  }, ...
         * ],
         * startKey: 'end',
         * ...
         */
    });
```

## Private Records

Private records are only accessible to the uploader of the record.

**Even the admin of the service will not have access to view the user's private data.**

The example below demonstrates uploading a private record:

```js
let data = {
    myData: "My private data"
};

let config = {
    table: {
        name: 'PrivateCollection',
        access_group: 'private'
    }
};

skapi.postRecord(data, config).then(record => {
    console.log(record); // Only the uploader will be able to access this record.
});
```

Then, if someone else tries to fetch the record, they will get an error:

```js
let config = {
    record_id: 'record_id_of_the_private_record'
};

skapi.getRecords(config)
    .catch(err=>alert(err.message)); // User has no access to private record.
```

## Grant Private Access

Users can grant private access of their record to other users by using the [`grantPrivateRecordAccess(params)`](/api-reference/database/README.md#grantprivateaccess) method.

```js
skapi.grantPrivateRecordAccess({
    record_id: 'record_id_of_the_private_record',
    user_id: 'user_id_to_grant_access'
})
```

When the user is granted access to the record, they will be able to fetch the record either if it's private or even if it has higher access group than the user.

Access granted users can also see all the records that is referencing this record at all access groups including private records.

You can read more about referencing records [here](/database/referencing.md).

## Remove Private Access

Users can remove access of their private record from other users by using the [`removePrivateRecordAccess(params)`](/api-reference/database/README.md#removeprivateaccess) method.

```js
skapi.removePrivateRecordAccess({
    record_id: 'record_id_of_the_private_record',
    user_id: 'user_id_to_remove_access'
})
```

## Allowing Others to Grant Private Access to Others

By default, The owner of the record has access to grant private access of the uploaded record to others.

The owner of the record can also allow other granted users to grant private access of the uploaded record to others.

When uploading a record, if the uploader set `source.allow_granted_to_grant_others` to `true` users with private access to the record can grant access to other users as well.

```js
skapi.postRecord(null, {
    table: {
        name: 'record_can_be_granted',
        access_group: 'private'
    },
    source: {
        allow_granted_to_grant_others: true
    }
}).then(r=>{
    // now other users with an private access can also grant private access to the record (r) to others.
})
```
<br><br>
# Updating a Record

The [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) method can also be used to update an existing record. You can specify the `record_id` in the `config` object in order to do so. 

[`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) will overwrite the user's record data to a new data.

For record config parameters, you only need to include the parameters you want to update along with the `record_id` parameter.
All other fields in the record will remain unchanged unless explicitly included in the method call.

```js
let updatedData = {
  newData: "Overwritten with new data."
};

let config = {
  record_id: 'record_id_to_update',
  table: {
    name: 'new_table_name',
    access_group: 'private' // change access group to private
  }
};

skapi.postRecord(updatedData, config).then(record => {
  console.log(record);
});
```

Example above overwrites record data to a new data and updated to a new table name.

:::tip
To update only the `config` of the record with `data` untouched, you can leave the first argument `data` to `undefined`.
Then, only the `config` will be updated with the previous data untouched.

```js
let new_config = {
  record_id: 'record_id_to_update',
  table: {
    name: 'new_table_name',
    access_group: 'private' // change access group to private
  }
};

skapi.postRecord(undefined, new_config).then(record => {
  console.log(record);
});
```
:::

:::info
Only the owner of the record can update a record.
:::

## Readonly Record

You can let user upload a readonly record that is immutable once it is created.
To create a readonly record, you can set the `readonly` parameter in the `config` object to `true`.

```js
let data = {
  myData: "Hello World"
};

let config = {
  table: 'my_collection',
  readonly: true
};

let read_only_record_id;
skapi.postRecord(data, config).then(record => {
  console.log(record);
  read_only_record_id = record.record_id;
});
```

When the record is created with `readonly` set to `true`, the user will not be able edit or delete the record anymore.

```js
skapi.postRecord({ myData: "Can this be updated?" }, { record_id: read_only_record_id }).catch(err=>{
    alert(err.message); // Record is readonly.
})
```<br><br># Handling Files

Skapi database is integrated with Skapi's cloud storage and CDN.
This allows you to upload any size of binary files to the database without any additional setup.

## Uploading Files

To upload files, you can use the HTML form `SubmitEvent` or `FormData` that includes `FileList` object when calling the [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) method.

Additionally, We can log the progress of the upload by passing a [ProgressCallback](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#progresscallback) in the `progress` parameter in the second argument of [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord).
This can be useful if the user is uploading huge files, you can show a progress bar.

Here's an example demonstrating how you can upload files using Skapi:

```html
<form onsubmit="skapi.postRecord(event, { table: 'my_photos', progress: (p)=>console.log(p) })
    .then(rec=>console.log(rec))">
    <input name="description" />
    <input name="picture" multiple type="file" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

The `name` attribute of the `FormData` will serve as the key name of the file data.
The file(s) will be uploaded under the key name `picture` in the `bin` key of the [RecordData](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#recorddata) as shown below:
```js
// record data
{
    record_id: '...',
    ...,
    bin: {
        picture: [
            {
                access_group: 'authorized',
                filename: '...',
                url: 'https://...',
                path: '.../...',
                size: 1234,
                uploaded: 1234
                getFile: () => {...};
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

The `bin` data will contain lists of [BinaryFile](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#binaryfile) objects.
This process is handled seamlessly without any complicated file handling required.

Once the files are uploaded, Skapi serves the files using a CDN with no additional setup required.

## Progress Information

When uploading files via [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) method, you can attach a [ProgressCallback](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#progresscallback) in the `progress` parameter when uploading files.
The [ProgressCallback](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#progresscallback) will trigger whenever there is a byte loaded to/from the backend.

```js
let progressCallback = (p) => {
    if(p.status === 'upload' && p.currentFile) {
        console.log(`Progress: ${p.progress}%`);
        console.log('Current uploading file:' + p.currentFile.name);
    }
}
skapi.postRecord(someData, { table: 'my_photos', progress: progressCallback })
```


## Downloading Files

To download files from the record, you can use the `getFile()` method on the [BinaryFile](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#binaryfile) object in the record.

Below is an example of how you can download a file from a record:

```js
skapi.getRecords({ record_id: 'record_id_with_file' }).then(rec => {
    let record = rec.list[0]; // record with files attached.
    
    /*
    // record
    {
        table: {
            name: 'my_photos',
            access_group: 'authorized'
        },
        record_id: '...',
        ...,
        bin: {
            picture: [
                {
                    access_group: 'authorized',
                    filename: '...',
                    url: 'https://...',
                    path: '.../...',
                    size: 1234,
                    uploaded: 1234
                    getFile: () => {...};
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    }
    */

    let fileToDownload = record.bin.picture[0]; // get the file object from the record
    
    fileToDownload.getFile(); // browser will download the file.
});
```

:::info
Uploaded files follow the access restrictions of the record.
User must have access to the record in order to download the file.
:::

`getFile()` allows you to download the file in various ways:
- `blob`: Downloads the file as a [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) object.
- `base64`: Downloads the file as a base64 string.
- `endpoint`: If the file access requires authentication or needs token update, you can request the a updated endpoint of the file.

If no argument is passed, the file will be downloaded from the web browser.

`getFile(dataType?: string, progress?: () => void )` method have two arguments:
- `dataType`: Type of ways for file to be downloaded. Can be `"blob"` or `"base64"` or `"endpoint"` url. By default, it will trigger download from the web browser.
- `progress`: Progress callback function. Can be useful when downloading large file as a blob and you want to show progress bar. (Will not work when download type is `endpoint` or web browser download.)

If the file has private access restriction, you must use the `endpoint` type to get the file endpoint URL.
The endpoint URL will be a signed URL that can expire after a certain amount of time.

If the file is an image or a video, you can use the url on img tag or video tag to display the file.

Below is an example of how you can get the endpoint URL of the access restricted private file (The user must have private access granted.):

```js
fileToDownload.getFile('endpoint').then(url => {
    console.log(url); // endpoint of the file. https://...
});

```

Below is an example of how you can download a file as a blob, base64 with progress callback:

```js
let progressInfo = p => {
    console.log(p); // Download progress information
};

fileToDownload.getFile('blob', progressInfo).then(b => {
    console.log(b); // Blob object of the file.
});

fileToDownload.getFile('base64', progressInfo).then(b => {
    console.log(b); // base64 string
});
```

## Removing Files

To remove files, use the `remove_bin` parameter in the `config` argument of the [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) method.
When updating a record, you can remove files by passing the `remove_bin` parameter as an array of [BinaryFile](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#binaryfile) objects or the endpoint url of the file that need to be removed from the record.

Here's an example demonstrating how you can remove files from a record:

```js
...
let fileToDelete = record.bin.picture[0]; // file object retrieved from the record.
skapi.postRecord(undefined, { record_id: 'record_id_with_file', remove_bin: [fileToDelete] });
```

If you have the endpoint URL of the file, you can also just pass the URL as a string in the `remove_bin` parameter:

```js
skapi.postRecord(undefined, { record_id: 'record_id_with_file', remove_bin: ['https://...'] });
```

If you want to remove all files from the record, you can pass the `remove_bin` parameter as `null`:

```js
skapi.postRecord(undefined, { record_id: 'record_id_with_file', remove_bin: null }); // removes all files from the record.
```

## Get File Information

You can use [`getFile()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getfile) method to get the file information just from the endpoint URL of the file.

Below is an example of how you can get the file information from the endpoint URL:

# Deleting Records

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method
:::

The [`deleteRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#deleterecords) method allows users to delete records that they own.
When the record is deleted, all the files that were uploaded to the record will be deleted as well.

The `params` object accepts similar parameters as the [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method.

If the `record_id` is provided, it will delete the record with the given `record_id`.


## Deleting Records by Record IDs

Here's an example that demonstrates how to delete multiple records using an array of record IDs:
```js
let query = {
    record_id: ['record_a_record_id','record_b_record_id']
};

skapi.deleteRecords(query).then(response => {
    // 'SUCCESS: records are being deleted. please give some time to finish the process.'
    console.log(response);
});
```

:::warning
You can only delete up to 100 record ID at a time.
:::

## Deleteing Records by Unique IDs

Here's an example that demonstrates how to delete multiple records using an array of unique IDs:
```js
let query = {
    unique_id: ['unique id of the record 1','unique id of the record 2']
};

skapi.deleteRecords(query).then(response => {
    // 'SUCCESS: records are being deleted. please give some time to finish the process.'
    console.log(response);
});
```

:::warning
You can only delete up to 100 unique ID at a time.
:::

## Deleting User's Records with Database Query

Here's an example of deleting all user's records uploaded in the "A" table with a public access group.

```js
let query = {
    table: {
        name: 'A',
        access_group: 'public'
    }
};

skapi.deleteRecords(query).then(response => {
    // 'SUCCESS: records are being deleted. please give some time to finish the process.'
    console.log(response);
});
```

You can use the database query however you like to let users delete bulk of records that they uploaded. (e.g. by access group, by table name, index, tag, reference, etc.)

:::tip
When deleting multiple records, the promise will return success immediately, but it may take some time for the deleted records to be reflected in the database.
:::

:::warning
When deleting records by database query, user will not delete records that they do not own, or records that are uploaded as read-only.

However, if the user is an admin, they can delete any records in the database. So be cafeful when admin is using this method.

Read more about admin access [here](/admin/intro.md).
:::

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`deleteRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#deleterecords) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`deleteRecords(params): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#deleterecords)<br><br># Table Information

Skapi keeps track of all the tables in your database.
You can fetch a list of table names and number of records in each tables and total database size consumed in the table using the [`getTables()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#gettables) method.

You can fetch a list of table using the `getTables()` method.

```js
skapi.getTables().then(response=>{
    console.log(response); // List of all tables in the database
})
```

### Querying tables

You can query table names that meets the `condition`.

```js
skapi.getTables({
    table: 'C',
    condition: '>'
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response); // Table names starting from 'C'
})
```

In this example, the condition property is set to `>`, and `table` is set to `C`.
This query will return the table names that come after table 'C' in lexographic order, such as 'Cc', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'... and so on.

To fetch the table names that starts with 'C', you can set the condition to `>=` instead.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`getTables()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#gettables) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getTables(query, fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<Table>>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#gettables)
<br><br>
# Indexing

When uploading records, you can set additional configurations in the `index` property.
Indexing allows you to categorize and search for records based on specific criteria.
The `index` object consists of the index's `name`, used for indexing, and its corresponding `value`, which is searchable.

## Configuring Indexing for Records

For example, let's consider a table of music albums. You can create an index for the `name` "year" and its corresponding `value` as the release year. This can be set when uploading/updating a record.

This enables searching for music albums by release year when quering records.

```js
let album = {
    title: "Getz/Gilberto",
    artist: "Stan Getz, João Gilberto",
    tracks: 10
};

let config = {
    table: "Albums",
    index: {
        name: "year",
        value: 1964
    }
};

skapi.postRecord(album, config);
```


## Querying with Index

Once indexed record is uploaded, you can fetch records based on the "year" in the "Albums" table.

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: "Albums",
    index: {
        name: "year",
        value: 1964
    }
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list); // List of albums released on year 1964.
});
```


## Querying Index with Conditions

You can broaden your search by using the `condition` parameter within the `index` parameter.

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: "Albums",
    index: {
        name: "year",
        value: 1960,
        condition: '>' // Greater than given value
    }
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list); // List of albums released after the year 1960.
});
```

The index value can be of type `number`, `string`, or `boolean`.

When the index value type is `number` or `boolean`, conditions work as they do with numbers.

When the index value type is `string`, `>` and `<` will search for strings that are higher or lower in the lexicographical order, respectively.
`>=` (more than or equal to) acts as a 'starts with' operation when searching for string values.

The `condition` parameter takes the following string values:

- `>`: Greater than the given value.
- `>=`: Greater or equal to the given value. When the value is `string`, it works as 'starts with' condition.
- `=`: Equal to the given value. (default)
- `<`: Lesser than the given value.
- `<=`: Lesser or equal to the given value.


:::warning
When querying an index with conditions, it will only return records with the same value type.

ex) '2' and 2 are different values.
:::


## Query Index with Range

In addition to conditions, you can also retrieve records based on a range of values in the index.
To do so, specify the `range` parameter in the `index` object within the [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method.

For example, consider the following scenario:

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: "Albums",
    index: {
        name: "year",
        value: 1960,
        range: 1970
    }
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list); // List of albums released from 1960 to 1970.
});
```

In the example above, the [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method will retrieve all records in the "Albums" table that have a "year" index value between 1960 and 1970 (inclusive).

:::warning
- When using the `range` parameter, the `value` and `range` parameter values should be same type of data.
- The `range` and `condition` parameter cannot be used simultaneously.
:::


## Query Index with Reserved Keywords

Skapi has reserved a few keywords to help with querying your records. 
The reserved keywords are:

- `$uploaded`: Fetches the timestamp(13 digits millisecond format) at which the record was created.
  
- `$updated`: Fetches the timestamp(13 digits millisecond format) at which the record was last updated.
  
- `$referenced_count`: Fetch by the number of records that are [referencing](/database/referencing.md) the record. This can be useful if you need a query like: 'Post that has the most comments'
  
- `$user_id`: Fetches list of record uploaded by given user ID.

With the exception of `$user_id`, all of these reserved keywords can be queried with `condition` and `range` just like any other index values. `$user_id` cannot be queried with condition or range.


## Querying Index with Reserved Keywords
For example, let's query records created after 2021:

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: "Albums",
    index: {
        name: '$uploaded',
        value: 1609459200000, // this timestamp is 2021 January 1,
        condition: '>'
    }
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list); // List of albums uploaded after 2021.
});
 
```

## Compound Index Names

When posting records, you can use compound index names to have more control over querying the records.
This makes it more flexible to search and retrieve records.

### Uploading a Record with a compound index name

In the example below, we are uploading a record with a compound index name:

```js
let album_data = {
    title: "Dukkha",
    tracks: 7
};

skapi.postRecord(album_data, {
    table: 'Album',
    index: {
        name: 'Band.AsianSpiceHouse.year',
        value: 2023
    }
})
```

In this example, we have created a compound index name by joining the artist type, artist name, and "year" with a period.
The `value` of this index can only be searched when using the full index name (Band.AsianSpiceHouse.year).

### Querying child level compound index names

When compound index name is used, you can also query records by artist type(Band), artist name(AsianSpiceHouse), or release year(2023).

For example, you can query all albums performed by a **'Band'** using the following code:

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: 'Album',
    index: {
        name: 'Band.',
        value: '',
        condition: '>' // More than
    }
}).then(response=>{
    console.log(response.list); // All albums by "Band" type artists.
})
```

Notice `index.name` value includes a period at the end: **'Band.'**.

This allows you to query the child index name of the compound index name as a `string` value.
Since the `index.value` is an empty string and the condition is set to "more than",
this will retrieve all records where the index name begins with **'Band.'**.

The next example shows how you can query albums by artist name.

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: 'Album',
    index: {
        name: 'Band.',
        value: 'Asian',
        condition: '>=' // Starts with
    }
}).then(response=>{
    console.log(response.list); // All albums by "Band" with band name starting with 'Asian'
})
```

In this example, the `value` of the index is set to "Asian" and the `condition` is set to "more than or equal".
This allows you to query all artist names starting with "Asian" where the index `name` begins with "Band."


### Querying with full compound index name

Finally, you can query the band Asian Spice House albums by release year as follows:

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: 'Album',
    index: {
        name: 'Band.AsianSpiceHouse.year',
        value: 2010,
        condition: '>'
    }
}).then(response=>{
    console.log(response.list); // All albums by Asian Spice House released after 2010.
})
```

:::warning
When querying the child index names from the compound index, you need to specify the index respecting the hierarchy of the compound index name. 

From the example above, you cannot simply use **'Band.year'** as an index name to query by the year values.
You must provide the full **'Band.AsianSpiceHouse.year'** as an index name if you want to query the actual value of the index.
:::

## Fetching Index Information

Skapi tracks the index information in each table. You can fetch the index information using the [`getIndexes()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getindex) method.

Index information is useful when you want to list all index names used in a table or find out the total number of the records indexed to that index name or average/total value of the index values.

The index information includes:

- `average_number`: The average of the number type values.
- `total_number`: The total sum of the number values.
- `number_count`: The total number of records with number as the index value.
- `average_bool`: The rate of true values for booleans.
- `total_bool`: The total number of true values for booleans.
- `bool_count`: The total number of records with boolean as the index value.
- `string_count`: The total number of records with string as the index value.
- `index_name`: The name of the index.


For example, let say we have a table called "VoteBoard" that lets user upload records with a compound index name such as "Vote.Beer".
The index value will be boolean.
```js
skapi.postRecord(null, {
    table: 'VoteBoard',
    index: {
        name: 'Vote.Beer',
        value: true // or false
    }
})
```

Then you can fetch information about the **"Vote.Beer"** index in the **"VoteBoard"** table to find out the rating of **"Vote.Beer"**.

```js
skapi.getIndexes({
    table: 'VoteBoard', // Table name is required
    index: 'Vote.Beer' // index name
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list[0]); // index information of "Vote.Beer"
});
```

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`getIndexes()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getindex) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getIndexes(query, fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<Index>>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getindex)

### Querying index value

Suppose you want to list all the indexes in a table and order them in a specific order.
Maybe there is multiple indexes such as "Vote.Beer", "Vote.Wine", "Vote.Coffee" and so on.
And you may want to know the rating of each index and order them by the rating.
In that case, you can use the `order.by` parameter in the `query`.

Example below lists all indexes under the compound index `Vote.` in the **"VoteBoard"** table ordered by `average_bool` from highest value:

:::warning
`order.by` only works on the values under the index name.
If your index name is a [compound index name](./#compound-index-names),
You should declare the parent index of your child compound index name.

For example, if you expect to get the index `Vote.Beer` from ordering `average_bool`, you should declare the parent index `Vote.` in the `index` parameter.
:::

```js
let config = {
    ascending: false
};

let query = {
    table: 'VoteBoard',
    index: 'Vote.',
    order: {
        by: 'average_bool'
    }
};

skapi.getIndexes(query, config).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list); // List of indexes ordered from high votes.
});
```

Note that in the `config` object, the `ascending` value is set to `false`.

So the list will be ordered in *descending* order from highest votes to lower votes.

For example, to list all indexes under "Vote." that has higher votes then 50% and order them by `average_bool`, you can do the following:

```js
let config = {
    ascending: false
};

let query = {
    table: 'VoteBoard',
    index: 'Vote.',
    order: {
        by: 'average_bool',
        value: 0.5,
        condition: '>'
    }
};

skapi.getIndexes(query, config).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list); // List of votes that rates higher then 50%, ordered from high votes.
});
```
<br><br>
# Tags

Tags are additional information that can be associated with a record. They provide additional search criteria to perform more detailed queries, either on their own or in combination with indexes. Unlike indexes, tags cannot be queried with conditional operators.

To add tags to a record, you can use the `config.tags` parameter in the [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord) method.
This parameter accepts a string or an array of strings or string with comma separated values, allowing you to add multiple tags to a single record.

## Adding Tags to a Record

Here's an example of how to add tags to a record:

```js
let record = {
    title: "Dukkha",
    artist: "Asian Spice House",
    tracks: 7
};

let config = {
    table: "Albums",
    index: {
        name: "year",
        value: 2023
    },
    tags: ['Indie', 'Experimental']
}

skapi.postRecord(record, config);
```

## Querying Records by Tag

You can also utilize tags in your queries.

Example below lists albums released after 2020, that have the tag 'Experimental'.

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: "Albums",
    index: {
        name: "year",
        value: 2020,
        condition: '>'
    },
    tag: 'Experimental'
}).then(response=>{
    // List of albums released after 2020, that have the tag 'Experimental'.
    console.log(response.list);
});
```

:::tip
To query multiple tags simultaneously, you can make multiple API calls and await them all at once in Javascript Promise.all().
Then you may sort the data as you wish.

Following Example below shows fetching albums with the tag 'Experimental' OR 'Indie'
:::

```js
let experimental = skapi.getRecords({
    table: "Albums",
    tag: 'Experimental'
})

let indie = skapi.getRecords({
    table: "Albums",
    tag: 'Indie'
});

Promise.all([experimental, indie]).then(res=>{
    let experimental = res[0].list;
    let indie = res[1].list;

    let or_list = {};
    for(let r of experimental) or_list[r.record_id] = r;
    for(let r of indie) or_list[r.record_id] = r;

    // 'Experimental' OR 'Indie' in { [record_id]: record } format.
    console.log(or_list);
})
```

## Fetching Tag Information

You can fetch all tags used in a table with [`getTags()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#gettags).

```js
skapi.getTags({
    table: 'MyTable'
}).then(response=>{
    console.log(response); // List of all tags in table named 'MyTable'
})
```
For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`getTags()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#gettags) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getTags(query, fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<Tag>>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#gettags)

### Querying tags

You can also query tags that meets the `condition`.

```js
skapi.getTags({
    table: 'MyTable',
    tag: 'A',
    condition: '>'
}).then(response=>{
    console.log(response); // List of all tags starting from 'A' in table named 'MyTable'
})
```

In this example, the condition property is set to `>`, and `table` is set to `A`.  This query will return the table names that come after table 'A' in lexographic order, such as 'Ab', 'B', 'C', 'D' and so on.
<br><br># Referencing

Users can reference another record when uploading a new record.

When records are referenced, users can retrieve records based on the one being referenced.

This feature is useful for building a discussion board similar to Reddit, comment section, rating board, tracking purchased items, like buttons etc.

To reference a record, you'll need to specify the `record_id` or `unique_id` of the record you want to reference in the `reference` parameter in the `config` object.

## Uploading a Record to be Referenced

First lets upload a record to be referenced.

```js
let data = {
    post: "What do you think of this post?"
};

let config = {
    unique_id: 'unique id of the post',
    table: 'Posts'
};

let referenced_record_id;

skapi.postRecord(data, config).then(response => {
    // The original post has been uploaded. Now, users can upload another record that references it.
    referenced_record_id = response.record_id;  // Record ID of the record to be referenced.
});
```

## Creating a Referencing Record

Note that we have uploaded a record to be referenced,
we can use the uploaded record's ID in `reference` when uploading a comment record.

```js
let commentRecord = {
    comment: "I like it!"
};

let commentConfig = {
    table: 'Comments',
    reference: referenced_record_id
};

skapi.postRecord(commentRecord, commentConfig);
```

## Fetching References

Now you can query all the records that references the original record by passing the record ID in the `reference` parameter in [`getRecords()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getrecords) method.:

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: 'Comments',
    reference: referenced_record_id,
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list);  // Array of comments of the reference record.
});
```

:::tip
A user cannot reference a record with a higher access group or 'private' access.
However, if the uploader has granted the private access of the record to the user, the user will be able to reference it.
:::

:::danger
Users who have private access granted to a record will also have access to all other private/higher access group records that is referenced.
To avoid unintended sharing of private records, do not permit users to upload a private record that references another record.
:::

## Creating a Referencing Record with Unique ID

When uploading a record, you can also reference the record using the unique ID.

```js
skapi.postRecord({
    comment: "I like it!"
}, {
    table: 'Comments',
    reference: 'unique id of the post'
});
```


## Fetching References with Unique ID

If the reference record has a unique ID setup, you can also fetch records based on the unique ID of the record being referenced.

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: 'Comments',
    reference: 'unique id of the post'
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list);  // Array of records in 'Comments' table referencing the record with the unique ID.
});
```

More on unique ID can be found [here](/database/unique-id.md).


## Using reference to fetch certain user's post

You can also query all the records posted by certain user giving a `user_id` as a value of `reference` parameter.

```js
skapi.getRecords({
    table: 'Comments',
    reference: 'user-id-whose-post-you-want'
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list);  // Array of records in 'Comments' table posted by a certain user
});
```


## Removing a reference

To remove a reference, set the the `reference` parameter to `null` when updating the record.

```js
skapi.postRecord(undefined, {
    record_id: 'record_id_of_the_comment_to_remove',
    reference: null
}).then(record => {
    console.log(record);  // The reference has been removed.
});
```

## Reference source settings in [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord)

When uploading record via [`postRecord()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#postrecord), you can set restrictions on referencing from other records using additional parameters in `source`.

- `source.referencing_limit`: Allowed maximum number of times that other records can reference the uploading record.
  This is useful if you are building ticketing system where only a certain number of people purchase a ticket.
  If this parameter is set to `null`, the number of references is unlimited. The default value is `null`.
  Set `referencing_limit` to `0` to prevent others to reference the uploading record.

- `source.prevent_multiple_referencing`: If set to `true`, single user will be allowed to reference this record only once.
  This is useful for building a voting system where each users are allowed to vote only once.

- `source.can_remove_referencing_records`: If set to `true`, the owner of the record has an authority to remove the referencing records.
  When the owner removes the record, all the referenceing records will be removed.
  This can be useful when you want to build a discussion board where the owner can remove the comments.
  The default value is `false`.

- `source.only_granted_can_reference`: When set to `true`, only the user who has granted private access to the record can reference this record.

- `source.referencing_index_restrictions`: You can set list of restrictions on the index values of the referencing record.
  This is useful when you want to restrict the referencing record to have certain index names and values.
  This only affects referencing records that has an index.


## Referencing Index Restrictions

You can set restrictions on the index values of the referencing record.
This is useful when you want to restrict the referencing record to have certain index values.
This only affects referencing records that has an index.

For example, you can set the index value range so the total rating value does not exceed a certain value.

Example below shows how you can build a review board where only **10** people are allowed to rate **1** to **5** and each user can only rate once.

It is important to set restrictions on index values for cases like rating systems where you want to prevent users from posting malicious data to mess up your index informations.

```js
let pollPost = skapi.postRecord({
    title: `How would you rate Stan Getz, João Gilberto's album "Getz/Gilberto"?`,
    description: "Only 10 people are allowed to vote"
}, {
    unique_id: 'Review board of GetzGilberto',
    table: 'ReviewBoard',
    source: {
        prevent_multiple_referencing: true,
        referencing_limit: 10,
        referencing_index_restrictions: [
            {
                name: 'Review.Album.GetzGilberto',
                value: 1,
                range: 5
            }
        ]
    }
})
```

As shown in the example above, the `referencing_index_restrictions` parameter is an array of objects that contains the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the index value. (required)
- `value`: The value of the index. (optional)
- `range`: The range of the index value. (optional)
- `condition`: The condition of the index value. (optional)

You can set many index restrictions by adding more objects to the array.

When the index restriction is set, the referencing record must have the same index name with same typed value and within the specified range.

If all optional parameters not set, the referencing record must have the same index name.

If `value` is set, the referencing record must have the same index name with the same value.

If `range` is set, the referencing record must have the same index name with the value within the specified range.

If `condition` is set, the referencing record must have the same index name with the index value that satisfies the condition to the `value`.
For example, if you want your referencing record's index value to be less than **5**, you can set the parameter as shown below:

```js
let pollPost = skapi.postRecord({
    title: `How would you rate Stan Getz, João Gilberto's album "Getz/Gilberto"?`,
    description: "Only 10 people are allowed to vote"
}, {
    unique_id: 'Review board of GetzGilberto',
    table: 'ReviewBoard',
    source: {
        prevent_multiple_referencing: true,
        referencing_limit: 10,
        referencing_index_restrictions: [
            {
                name: 'Review.Album.GetzGilberto',
                value: 5,
                condition: '<'
            }
        ]
    }
})
```

`condition` can be one of the following: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

`condition` cannot be used with `range`.


## Creating a Poll with Restricted Referencing

Now people can post a review by referencing the **pollPost**:

```js
// Now only 10 people can post references for this record
skapi.postRecord({
    comment: "This rocks! I'd give 4.5 out of 5!"
}, {
    table: 'ReviewBoard',
    reference: 'Review board of GetzGilberto',
    index: {
        name: 'Review.Album.GetzGilberto',
        value: 4.5
    }
});
```

Note that the "Review.Album.GetzGilberto" `index` uses a `value` of type `number` so you can later retrieve the average rating and total sum of the values.


## Powerful Ways to Use Reference Records

1. Discussion board
   
   The owner of the reference record has all access to the referencing records.
   
   Meaning, the user who uploaded the source of the reference record can have authority to delete the referencing records owned by other users, have access to all access levels referencing records including private records.

   This is useful when you want to build a discussion board where the owner can remove the comments, let users post private comments to reference owner.
   
2. Rating/voting system
   
   You can set restrictions on the number of times a record can be referenced, prevent multiple referencing for each users, and restrict the index values of the referencing record.

   While Skapi database works as schema-less in nature, you can use this characteristic to have more control over how your users can post data to your service.

3. Sharing private data between limited users
   
   If the reference record has a private access group, only the users who have access to the reference record can access the referencing records.
<br><br>
# Subscription


Skapi database provides subscription feature.

Records uploaded with subscription group requires users to subscribe to the uploader to have access to the records.

You can let users upload records to the subscription table number by setting `table.subscription.is_subscription_record` to `true`.

When user uploads a record to the subscription table, other users must subscribe to the uploader to have access to the records.

Subscription feature can useful when you are building a social media platform, blog, etc.

With the subscription feature, user can also block certain users from accessing their subscription group records.

It can be used to track the number of subscribers of the user, feed, notify mass users, etc.

Lets assume **user 'A'** uploads a record in table 'Posts' with subscription group 1.

```js
// User 'A' uploads record in subscription table.
skapi.postRecord(null, {
  table: {
    name:'Posts',
    access_group: 'authorized',
    subscription: {
      is_subscription_record: true
    }
}})
```

To allow other users to access the records that requires subscription, they must first subscribe to the uploader using the [`subscribe()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#subscribe) method:

### [`subscribe(option): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#subscribe)

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method
:::

Lets assume **user 'B'** wants to access **user 'A'**s subscription record, **user 'B'** will need to subscribe to **user 'A'**.

```js
// User 'B' subscribes to user 'A'.
skapi.subscribe({
  user_id: 'user_id_of_user_A',
  get_feed: true // Required to enable the get_feed method
});
```

:::tip
To use the  [`getFeed()`](/database/subscription.html#getting-feed) method later, be sure to include the parameter ```get_feed: true``` shown in [`subscribe(option): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#subscribe)
:::

Once the **user 'B'** has subscribed to **user 'A'**,
**user 'B'** can now have access to the records in that subscription table.

```js
// User 'B' now can get records that requires subscription of user 'A'
skapi.getRecords({
  table: {
    name: 'Posts',
    access_group: 'authorized',
    subscription: 'user_id_of_user_A'
  }
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.list); // All posts user 'A' uploaded to table 'Posts' in subscription group 1.
});
```

:::tip
Number of subscribers of the user will be tracked in [UserPublic](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#userpublic) object
that can be retrieved using the [`getUsers()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getusers) method.
:::


### Unsubscribing

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method
:::

Users can unsubscribe from the subscription group 1 they have subscribed to using the [`unsubscribe()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#unsubscribe) method.

```js
// User 'B'
skapi.unsubscribe({
    user_id: 'user_id_of_user_A',
})
```
For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`unsubscribe()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#unsubscribe) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`unsubscribe(option): Promise<User | string>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#unsubscribe)

:::warning
When unsubscribed, subscription information may need some time to be updated. (Usually almost immediate)
:::


## Blocking and Unblocking Subscribers

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method
:::

One of the benifit of subscription feature is that users can block certain users from accessing their subscription level records.
But as metioned above, subscription is not meant to be used as a security restriction.

Even when user has blocked certain users, they still have access to the files attached to the records since the file access level is not restricted to the subscription access unless it's private or higher access group than the accessing user.

Other than files, blocked users will not have access to any of the record data in the subscription access level.

To block a subscriber, user can call the [`blockSubscriber()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#blocksubscriber) method:

### Blocking a Subscriber

```js
// User 'A' blocks user 'B' from accessing all subscription group 1.
skapi.blockSubscriber({
    user_id: 'user_id_of_user_B',
}).then(res=>{
    // User 'B' no longer have access to user A's subscription group 1.
})
```

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`blockSubscriber()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#blocksubscriber) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`blockSubscriber(option): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#blocksubscriber)


### Unblocking a Subscriber

```js
// User 'A' unblocks user 'B' from subscription group 1.
skapi.unblockSubscriber({
    user_id: 'user_id_of_user_B',
}).then(res=>{
    // User 'B' now has access to user A's subscription group 1.
})
```
For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`unblockSubscriber()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#unblocksubscriber) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`unblockSubscriber(option): Promise<string>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#unblocksubscriber)

## Listing subscriptions

The [`getSubscriptions()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getsubscriptions) method retrieves subscription information from the database.

### params:
- `subscriber`: The user ID of the subscriber.
- `subscription`: The user ID of the uploader and the subscription group.
- `blocked`: Set to `true` to only retrieve blocked subscriptions.

Either the `params.subscriber` or `params.subscription` value must be provided.

### Examples

```js
/**
 * Retrieve all subscription information where userB is the subscriber
 */
skapi.getSubscriptions({
  subscriber: "userB_user_id"
}).then((response) => {
  console.log(response.list);
});

/** 
 * Retrieve all subscription information where userA is being subscribed to
 */
skapi.getSubscriptions({
  subscription: "userA_user_id"
}).then((response) => {
  console.log(response.list);
});

/**
 * Check if userB is subscribed to userA
 */
skapi.getSubscriptions({
  subscriber: "userB_user_id",
  subscription: "userA_user_id"
}).then((response) => {
  console.log(response.list?.[0]);
});
```
For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`getSubscriptions()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getsubscriptions) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getSubscriptions(params, fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<RecordData>>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getsubscriptions)

## Getting Feed

The [`getFeed()`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getfeed) method retrieves the feed of the user.

This method retrieves all the records that the user has ever subscribed to.

You can use this method to build a feed page for the user.

### Examples

```js
/**
 * Retrieve all feed of userB that are records of access_group is 1
 */
skapi.getFeed({access_group: 1}).then((response) => {
  console.log(response.list); // all records that is access_group 1 that userB has ever subscribed to.
});
```

### [`getFeed(fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<RecordData>>`](/api-reference/database/README.md#getfeed)<br><br># Skapi HTML Database Full Example

You can get your own service ID from [Skapi](https://www.skapi.com)<br><br># Connecting to Realtime

Skapi's realtime connection let's you transfer JSON data between users in realtime.
This is useful for creating chat applications, notifications, etc.

## Creating Connection

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method
:::

Before you start sending realtime data, you must create a realtime connection.
You can create a realtime connection by calling [`connectRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#connectrealtime) method.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`connectRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#connectrealtime) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`connectRealtime(RealtimeCallback): Promise<WebSocket>`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#connectrealtime)

Once the connection is established, you can start receiving realtime data from the [RealtimeCallback](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#realtimecallback).

```js
let RealtimeCallback = (rt) => {
    // Callback executed when there is data transfer between the users.
    /**
    rt = {
      type: 'message' | 'error' | 'success' | 'close' | 'notice' | 'private' | 'reconnect' | 'rtc:incoming' | 'rtc:closed';
      message?: any;
      connectRTC?: (params: RTCReceiverParams, callback: RTCEvent) => Promise<RTCResolved>; // Incoming RTC
      hangup?: () => void; // Reject incoming RTC connection.
      sender?: string; // user_id of the sender
      sender_cid?: string; // scid of the sender
      sender_rid?: string; // group of the sender
      code?: 'USER_LEFT' | 'USER_DISCONNECTED' | 'USER_JOINED' | null; // code for notice messeges
    }
    */
    console.log(rt);
}

skapi.connectRealtime(RealtimeCallback);
```

In the example above, the [RealtimeCallback](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#realtimecallback) function will be executed when there is data transfer between the users.

When the callback is executed, message will be passed as an object with `type` and `message` properties.

- `type` Shows the type of the received message as below:
  
  "message": When there is data transfer between the users.

  "error": When there is an error. Usually websocket connection has an error and will be disconnected.

  "success": When the connection is established. This may fire on initial connection, or when the reconnection attempt is successful.

  "close": When the connection is intentionally closed by the user.

  "notice": When there is a notice. Usually notice users when the user in a room has joined, left, or being disconnected.

  "private": When there is private data transfer between the users.

  "reconnect": When there is reconnection attempt. This happens after user leaves the browser tab or device screen is lock for certain amount of time, and the user comes back to the application. The websocket can disconnect when the application is left unfocus for some period of time.
  

- `message` is the data passed from the server. It can be any JSON data.
- `sender` is the user ID of the message sender. It is only available when `type` is "message" or "private".
- `sender_cid` is the connection ID of the message sender. It can be used to track the sender's connected device.

## Closing Connection

You can close the realtime connection by calling [`closeRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#closerealtime) method.

```js
skapi.closeRealtime();
```

When the connection is successfully closed, [RealtimeCallback](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#realtimecallback) will trigger with following callback data:

```ts
{
  type: 'close',
  message: 'WebSocket connection closed.'
}
```

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`closeRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#closerealtime) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`closeRealtime(): Promise<void>`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#closerealtime)

:::tip
When the user closes the tab or refresh the browser, the connection will be closed automatically.
And when the connection is closed user will be removed from the group.
:::<br><br># Sending Realtime Data

Once the realtime connection is established, users can start sending realtime data to another user.

## Sending Data to a User

User can send any JSON data over to any users by using [`postRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime) method.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`postRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`postRealtime(message, recipient, notification): Promise<{ type: 'success', message: string }>`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime)

:::warning
The receiver must also be connected to the realtime connection to receive the data.
:::

::: code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.postRealtime(event, 'recipient_user_id').then(u=>console.log(u))">
    <input name="msg" required><input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.postRealtime({ msg: "Hello World!" }, 'recipient_user_id').then(res => console.log(res));
```

:::

Example above shows how to send realtime data to a user with an id: 'recipient_user_id' (Should be the user_id of user's profile).

[`postRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime) method can be used directly from the form element as shown in the example above.
[`postRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime) takes two arguments:
- `message`: The data to be sent to the recipient. It can be any JSON parsable data, or a SubmitEvent object.
- `recipient`: The user ID of the recipient or the name of the group the user have joined.
- `notification`: Notification to send with the realtime message, or notification to use when user is not connected to realtime. See [`Sending Notifications`](/notification/send-notifications.html#sending-notifications)

When the message is sent successfully, the method will return the following object:
```ts
{
  type: 'success',
  message: 'Message sent.'
}
```

On the receiver's side, the message will be received as an argument as an object with `type` and `message` properties through the [RealtimeCallback](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#realtimecallback) that has been set when creating the realtime connection via [`connectRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#connectrealtime) method.
<br><br># Realtime Groups

Realtime groups are used to send realtime data to multiple users at once.
This can be used to create group chats, group notifications, etc.

## Joining a Group

Users can join a group by calling [`joinRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#joinrealtime) method.

params argument takes the following parameters:
- `group`: The name of the group to join.

Group name can be anything you want.
If the group does not exist, it will be created automatically, otherwise the user will be joined to the existing group.

```js
skapi.joinRealtime({ group: 'HelloWorld' }).then(res => {
    console.log(res.message) // Joined realtime message group: "HelloWorld".
});
```

When the user is joined to the group successfully, the method will return the following object:

```ts
{
  type: 'success',
  message: 'Joined realtime message group: "HelloWorld"'.
}
```
For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`joinRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#joinrealtime) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`joinRealtime(params): Promise<{ type: 'success', message: string }>`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#joinrealtime)

:::tip
Even if the user has joined the group, they can still receive realtime data sent individually to them.
:::

## Sending Data to a Group

Once the user have joined the group, user can send any JSON data over to a group by using [`postRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime) method.
Any users in the group will receive the data.

The example below shows how to send realtime data to a group named "HelloWorld":

::: code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.postRealtime(event, 'HelloWorld').then(u=>console.log(u))">
    <input name="msg" required><input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.postRealtime({ msg: "Hello World!" }, 'HelloWorld').then(res => console.log(res));
```
:::

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`postRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`postRealtime(message, recipient): Promise<{ type: 'success', message: string }>`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime)

:::warning
The user must be joined to the group to send data to the group.
:::

## Leaving, Changing Groups

Users can join only one group at a time.
If you want your user to change groups, you can call [`joinRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#joinrealtime) method with a different `params.group` value.

Also, if you want to leave the group, you can call [`joinRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#leaverealtime) method with a `params.group` value as empty `string` or `null`.


## Listing Groups

Users can get a list of realtime groups by calling [`getRealtimeGroups()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#getrealtimegroups) method.

Example below shows listing all groups existing in your service:

```js
skapi.getRealtimeGroups().then(res => {
    console.log(res.list) // [{ group: 'HelloWorld', number_of_users: 1 }, ...]
});
```

You can search groups by the name.
Below example shows how to search group names that start with "Hello":

```js
skapi.getRealtimeGroups({ searchFor: 'group', value: 'Hello', condition: '>=' }).then(res => {
    console.log(res.list) // [{ group: 'HelloWorld', number_of_users: 1 }, ...]
});
```

You can also list groups that have more than 10 users:

```js
skapi.getRealtimeGroups({ searchFor: 'number_of_users', value: 10, condition: '>=' }).then(res => {
    console.log(res.list) // [{ group: 'HelloUniverse', number_of_users: 11 }, ...]
});
```

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`getRealtimeGroups()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#getrealtimegroups) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getRealtimeGroups(params?, fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<{ group: string; number_of_users: number; }>>`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#getrealtimegroups)

## Listing Users in a Group

Users can get a list of users in a group by calling [`getRealtimeUsers()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#getrealtimeusers) method.

Example below shows listing all users in the "HelloWorld" group:

```js
skapi.getRealtimeUsers({ group: 'HelloWorld' }).then(res => {
    console.log(res.list) // [{user_id: 'user_a', connection_id: 'user_cid'}, ...]
});
```

You can also search users in the group by their user ID.
This is useful if you want to check if the user is in the group.

```js
skapi.getRealtimeUsers({ group: 'HelloWorld', user_id: 'user_a' }).then(res => {
    console.log(res.list) // [{user_id: 'user_a', connection_id: 'user_cid'}]
});
```

please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`getRealtimeUsers(params, fetchOptions?): Promise<DatabaseResponse<{ user_id:string; connection_id:string; }[]>>`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#getrealtimeusers)<br><br># Notifications

Skapi provides methods to manage push notifications, including subscribing, unsubscribing, and sending notifications. This guide explains how to implement push notifications using Skapi from the client side.

:::danger HTTPS REQUIRED.
Notifications only works on HTTPS environment.
You need to setup a HTTPS environment when developing a notifications feature for your web application.

You can host your application in skapi.com or host from your personal servers.
:::

## Subscribing to Notifications

To receive push notifications, users must first subscribe. This requires obtaining a VAPID key and registering a service worker. It is possible to get the VAPID key by calling the method [`vapidPublicKey()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#vapidpublickey) and after subscribe by using the method [`subscribeNotification()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#subscribenotification).

### Steps:
1. Retrieve the VAPID key using [`vapidPublicKey()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#vapidpublickey).
2. Request notification permission from the device user.
3. Add the service worker [`sw.js`](#service-worker-sw-js) file to your environment.
4. Register a service worker and request notification permissions.
5. Subscribe to push notifications using `navigator.serviceWorker.pushManager.subscribe()`.
6. Send the subscription details to Skapi using [`subscribeNotification()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#subscribenotification).

### Code Example:
```js
/**
 * Converts a Base64 string into a Uint8Array, required for push subscriptions.
 * This function ensures correct padding and decoding.
 */
function urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {
    // Ensure the Base64 string has the correct padding
    const padding = "=".repeat((4 - (base64String.length % 4)) % 4);
    const base64 = (base64String + padding)
        .replace(/-/g, "+") // Convert URL-safe characters back
        .replace(/_/g, "/");

    // Decode Base64 to binary
    const rawData = window.atob(base64);
    const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);

    // Convert binary data into a Uint8Array
    for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {
        outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    
    return outputArray;
}

// Retrieve the VAPID public key from Skapi
const vapidResponse = await skapi.vapidPublicKey();
const vapid = vapidResponse.VAPIDPublicKey;

// Check if the browser supports service workers
if (!("serviceWorker" in navigator)) {
    alert("Service workers are not supported in this browser.");
    return;
}

// Request notification permission from the user
const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();
if (permission !== "granted") {
    alert("Permission not granted for notifications");
    return;
}

// Register the service worker (sw.js should handle push events)
const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register("/sw.js");

// Ensure the service worker is ready
await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;

// Subscribe to push notifications using the VAPID public key
const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({
    userVisibleOnly: true, // Ensures notifications are always visible to the user
    applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(vapid), // Convert VAPID key to Uint8Array
}).then(sub => sub.toJSON()); // Convert subscription object to JSON format

// Log the subscription object for debugging
console.log("Subscription object:", subscription);

// Send the subscription details to Skapi to store the user's push subscription
await skapi.subscribeNotification(subscription.endpoint, subscription.keys);
```

## Unsubscribing to Notifications

To stop receiving notifications, users need to unsubscribe by calling the method [`unsubscribenotification()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#unsubscribenotification) and passing the endpoint and keys as parameters. 

### Steps:
1. Retrieve the current push subscription from `navigator.serviceWorker.ready.pushManager.getSubscription()`.
2. If a subscription exists, call `unsubscribe()` on it.
3. Notify Skapi by calling [`unsubscribeNotification()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#unsubscribenotification).

### Code Example:
```js
// Ensure the service worker is ready before interacting with push notifications
const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;

// Retrieve the current push subscription (if it exists)
const subscription = await registration.pushManager.getSubscription();

// Check if there is an active subscription
if (!subscription) {
    console.error("No subscription found"); // Log an error if the user is not subscribed
    return;
}

// Convert the subscription object to a plain JSON format
const subscriptionJSON = subscription.toJSON();

// Unsubscribe the user from push notifications
await subscription.unsubscribe();

// Inform Skapi to remove this subscription from its records
const response = await skapi.unsubscribeNotification(subscription.endpoint, subscriptionJSON.keys);
```

## Service Worker (`sw.js`)

A service worker file (`sw.js`) is required to handle incoming push notifications and user interactions. It runs in the background, allowing notifications to be received even when the site is closed. This file must be present in your project and correctly registered; otherwise, push notifications won’t work.

### Code Example:
```js
self.addEventListener('push', function(event) {
    const data = event.data.json();
    const title = data.title || "Default Title";
    const options = {
        body: data.body || "Default Body",
        icon: 'icon-192x192.png',
        badge: 'icon-192x192.png'
    };
    
    event.waitUntil(
        self.registration.showNotification(title, options)
    );
});

self.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {
    event.notification.close();
    let url = event.target.location.origin;
    event.waitUntil(
        clients.openWindow(url)
    );
});
```

## Sending Notifications

You can let users use [`postRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#postrealtime) to send notification to each other.
In case the recipient is not connected to realtime, you can set the `notification` argument to notify user with notification message.

```js
skapi.postRealtime(
    { msg: "Hello World!" },
    'recipient_user_id',
    { 
        title: "New Message",
        body: "Someone sent you a message!"
    }
).then(res => console.log(res));
```

If the receiver has subscribed to push notification API, they will receive the notification message that is set in `notification` argument.

Below example shows how to send notification regardless user is connected to realtime connection. By setting `always` options to `true`, notification will always be triggered or the receiver.

```js
skapi.postRealtime(
    { msg: "Hello World!" },
    'recipient_user_id',
    { 
        title: "New Message",
        body: "Someone sent you a message!",
        config: { always: true }
    }
).then(res => console.log(res));
```

## Sending Notifications (For Admins)

Admins can use the [`pushNotification()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#pushnotification) method to send notifications to users.
**Only admins** can use this method to send notifications to **all** users.
You can also target a specific user or multiple users by providing their IDs. If no user IDs are specified, the notification will be sent to all users who have subscribed to notifications in your system.

### Steps:
1. Call [`pushNotification()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#pushnotification) with the title and body.
2. Optionally, provide user IDs to send notifications to specific users.
3. If no user IDs are provided, the notification will be sent to all subscribers.

### Code Examples:
```js
skapi.pushNotification(
    { 
        title: "Hello",
        body: "Hi there!"
    }
); // Sends to all subscribers
```

```js
skapi.pushNotification(
    { 
        title: "Admin Alert",
        body: "Only for selected users"
    },
    ["user1", "user2"]
);
```
<br><br># WebRTC

Skapi provides easy integration of WebRTC, allowing developers to quickly set up real-time communication features in their applications.

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables peer-to-peer media and data streaming between two parties.
This can be used for video calls, voice calls, and data exchange, making it a versatile tool for various real-time communication needs.

:::danger HTTPS REQUIRED.
WebRTC only works on HTTPS environment.
You need to setup a HTTPS environment when developing a WebRTC feature for your web application.

You can host your application in skapi.com or host from your personal servers.
:::

## Creating RTC Connection

To create RTC connection, both party needs to be online and need to utilize realtime connection.

1. Both party should create realtime connection by using [`connectRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#connectrealtime) method.

2. Once both parties are connected to realtime, both parties should join same realtime group by using [`joinRealtime()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#joinrealtime)

3. Now both parties can see each other's `connection ID(cid)` either by calling [`getRealtimeUsers()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#getrealtimeusers) method or from the [RealtimeCallback](/api-reference/data-types/README.md#realtimecallback).
   
   One of the party can request RTC connection by using the opponent's `cid` with [`connectRTC()`](/api-reference/realtime/README.md#connectrtc) method.

4. If media streaming is used, users should give permission to allow their device to be used.


Below is an example code of the process:


### 1. Basic UI Interface

Here we will add video element to display users and simple dialog to display incomming calls.

```html
<!-- skapi should be previously initialized... -->

<style>
    video {
        width: 320px;
        height: 240px;
        border: 1px solid black;
    }
</style>

<!-- Below are the video elements which it will display incoming / outgoing media streams -->
<video id="localVideo" autoplay muted></video>
<video id="remoteVideo" autoplay></video>

<!-- This will be a dialog for outgoing, incomming calls -->
<dialog id="call_dialog"></dialog>
```

### 2. Setting Up Realtime and RTC

Below is an simple example of setting up RTC video call.

```js
let call = null; // This will later be defined to resolved RTC connection object.

// RTC event listener
// This callback is used on connectRTC() on both calling and receiving side.
function RTCEvent(e) {
    if (e.type === 'track') {
        // Incoming Media Stream...
        document.getElementById('remoteVideo').srcObject = e.streams[0];
        call_dialog.close();
    }
}
// Realtime event listener
// This callback will listen to user joining the room.
function RealtimeCallback(rt) {
    if(rt.type === 'notice') {
        if(rt.code === 'USER_JOINED') {
            if(call) return;

            // When opponent joins a room, and it's not the user itself, user can make a RTC call
            if(skapi.user.user_id !== rt.sender) {
                call = await skapi.connectRTC({cid: rt.sender_cid, media: { audio: true, video: true}}, RTCEvent);

                call_dialog.innerHTML = /*html*/`
                    <p>Outgoing call</p>
                    <button onclick="call.hangup(); call_dialog.close();">Reject</button>
                `;

                call_dialog.showModal(); // Display outgoing call dialog

                rtcConnection = await call.connection; // Save resolved RTC connection object
                document.getElementById('localVideo').srcObject = rtcConnection.media; // Show outgoing local media stream
            }
        }
    }

    if (rt.type === 'rtc:incoming') {
        // incomming rtc call
        call = rt;

        call_dialog.innerHTML = /*html*/`
            <p>Incoming call</p>
            <button onclick='
                call.connectRTC({ media: {audio: true, video: true} }, RTCEvent)
                    .then(rtc => {
                        rtcConnection = rtc; // Save resolved RTC connection object
                        document.getElementById("localVideo").srcObject = rtcConnection.media; // Show outgoing local media stream
                        call_dialog.close();
                    })
            '>Accept</button>
            <button onclick="call.hangup(); call_dialog.close();">Reject</button>
        `;

        call_dialog.showModal(); // Display incoming call dialog
    }

    else if (rt.type === 'rtc:closed') {
        // rtc connection is closed
        call = null;
    }
}

skapi.connectRealtime(RealtimeCallback); // Connect to realtime
skapi.joinRealtime({ group: 'RTCCall' }); // Join a realtime group

Go to your service page, and click on the **Service Settings** tab.

Here, you can see the information of your service data usage, subscription model for your service.

Below are some toggle settings you can configure for your service.

## Disable/Enable

You can disable your service temporarily from the service dashboard.

This is useful when you need to go under maintainance while temporarily blocking the access to your service without losing the data.
When you disable your service, all the requests to your service will be blocked, and the service will be shown as disabled in the **My Services** page.

:::warning
Disabling your service will not pause your subscription. You will still be charged for the service even when it is disabled.
:::


## Allow Signup

You can prevent user signup by turning off this option.
This setting will prevent anyone to signup or prevent anyone from removing their account in your service.

If this option is turned off, only the admin can create, disable user accounts from the **Users** page.
This is useful when you want to create a private service for a specific group of users.


## Prevent Inquiry

You can prevent users from sending inquiries to your service by turning off this option.

This is useful when you are not planning to use the [`sendInquiry()`](/api-reference/email/README.md#sendinquiry) method, and want to prevent spam.


## Freeze Database

You can freeze your database to prevent any write operations.

When you freeze your database, all your user's write operations will be blocked, and only the read operations will be allowed.
When this in enabled only the service owner can write to the database.<br><br># Additional Settings

Go to your service page, and click on the **Service Settings** tab.

Below the toggle settings, you can see the additional settings you can configure for your service.

## Service Name

You can set the service name in your service settings.

The service name can be used to identify your service in the **My Services** page, and also can be used to replace [`Automated Email's placeholders`](/email/email-templates.md#template-placeholders).


## CORS

In your service settings, you can set the CORS setting to allow the request from the specific domain.

When left empty, the CORS setting will be set to `*` by default. Otherwise, you can set the CORS setting to the specific domain, for example, `https://example.com`.
You can also set multiple domains by separating them with a comma, for example, `https://example.com,https://example2.com`.

When the CORS setting is configured, requests from other domains will be blocked.

In production, it is recommended to set the CORS setting to the specific domain to prevent unauthorized access to your service.


## Secret Key

Skapi provides API bridge to your custom APIs.

For example, you might have your own external server that you want your users to connect to.

You can set your own secret key to protect your own APIs from unauthorized access.

For more information, refer [secure post request](/api-bridge/secure-post-request.html#secure-post-request) to your custom APIs.<br><br># Delete Service

:::tip
The delete service button will only be shown if your subscription has been expired, or you are in the trial plan.
:::

You can delete your service from the service settings page.

The delete service button is located at the bottom of the service settings page.

When you click the delete service button, you will be asked to confirm the deletion of your service.

:::danger
When you delete your service, all the data related to your service will be deleted permanently, and cannot be recovered.
:::<br><br># API Bridge

Skapi's API Bridge allows your service to connect external API's.

API Bridge provides [`secureRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#securerequest) and [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) methods to make secure requests to your custom API's.

[`secureRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#securerequest) is used to make a secure request to your custom API's.
[`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) is used to make a request to your 3rd party API with a client secret key.<br><br># Secure Post Request

You can use [`secureRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#securerequest) method to make a secure `POST` request to your custom API's.

:::warning
User must be logged in to call this method.
:::

:::warning
The [`secureRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#securerequest) method does not support HTML Forms.
:::

The `params` object accepts the following properties:
 - `url`: A string representing the URL of your custom API.
 - `data`: An object representing the data to be sent to your custom API.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`secureRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#securerequest) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`secureRequest(params): Promise<any>`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#securerequest)

## Example: Making a secure request to your custom API

Below is an example of a user making a secure request to your custom API that are hosted in `http://your.custom.api.com:3000/myapi`

```js
skapi.secureRequest({
    url: 'http://your.custom.api.com:3000/myapi',
    data: {
        some_data: 'Hello'
    }
}).then(response => {
    // response from your custom API
    console.log(response);
});
```

Skapi will mirror your request to your custom API. From your API, it receives user information along with the request data.
If you have set the secret key in your [service settings](/service-settings/additional.md) page, the request will contain your secret key.

You can have your custom API's to check the secret key in the request data. If the secret key is not matched, you can return the error response.

Below is an example of handling the request from your custom API:

## Node.js Example

```js
const http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    if (request.method === 'POST') {
        if (request.url === '/myapi') {
            let body = '';

            request.on('data', function (data) {
                body += data;
            });

            request.on('end', function () {
                body = JSON.parse(body);
                console.log(body);

                // {
                //     "user": {
                //         "user_id": "...",
                //         "group": 1,
                //         "locale": "KR",
                //         "request_locale": "KR",
                //         ...
                //     },
                //     "data": {"some_data": "Hello"},
                //     "api_key": 'your api secret key',
                // }

                if (body.api_key === 'your api secret key') {
                    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                    // do something
                    response.end('success');
                } else {
                    response.writeHead(401, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                    response.end("api key mismatch");
                }
            });
        }
    }
}).listen(3000);
```

## Python Example

```py
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
import json

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_OPTION(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.end_headers()

    def do_POST(self):
        print("POST")
        content_length = int(self.headers["Content-Length"])
        body = json.loads(self.rfile.read(content_length).decode("utf-8"))
        print(body)
        
        # {

        #         ...
        #     },
        #     "data": {"some_data": "Hello"},
        #     "api_key": 'your api secret key',
        # }

        if self.path == "/myapi":
            if body.get("api_key") == "your api secret key":
                self.send_response(200)
                self.end_headers()
                self.wfile.write("success".encode("utf-8"))
            else:
                self.send_response(401)
                self.end_headers()
                self.wfile.write("api key mismatch".encode("utf-8"))

myServer = HTTPServer(("", 3000), MyServer)

try:
    myServer.serve_forever()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    myServer.server_close()
```
<br><br># Client Secret Request

If you are using 3rd party API's that requires a client secret, you can use [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) to make a secure `POST` or `GET` request to your 3rd party API's.

First you need to save your client secret key in your **Client Secret** page.

1. Navigate to the **Client Secret Key** page from your service page.
  ![Client Secret Key](/clientmen.png)

1. Click on the **Register Client Secret Key** button to add a new client secret key.
  ![Register Client Secret Key](/clientinput.png)

You can add a new client secret key by providing a name for the key and the client secret key value.

The checkbox indicates whether the key is public or private.
The `Name` field is the name of the key that you will use when defining the `clientSecretName` parameter in the [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) method.
The `$CLIENT_SECRET` field is the value that you will use as a placeholder in the `data`, `params`, or `headers` or `url` parameter of the [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) method.

From the list of client secret keys, you can see the security settings, the name, and the masked client secret of your keys.

:::tip
The access setting of the client secret key can be set to either **public** or **private**.

**private** means that only the users that are logged in can have access to your 3rd party api, while **public** means anybody can have access to your 3rd party api.
**private** keys are indicated with a check mark in the column with the lock icon.
:::

Once the client secret key is saved, you can use the [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) method below to make secure requests to your 3rd party API's.

The list parameters of `params` of the method is shown as below:

  - `url`: A string representing the URL of your 3rd party API.
  - `clientSecretName`: A string representing the key name of the client secret key you may have saved in your service dashboard.
  - `method`: A string representing the method of the request. It can be either "GET" or "POST".
  - `headers`: An object representing the headers of the request.
  - `data`: An object representing the data to be sent to your 3rd party API. It is only used when `method` is "POST".
  - `params`: An object representing the query string parameters of the request. It is only used when `method` is "GET".

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`clientSecretRequest(params): Promise<any>`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest)

:::warning
When using `clientSecretRequest()`, you must include the `$CLIENT_SECRET` placeholder string in the `data` or `params` or `headers` or `url` parameter value.
:::

## Example: Making a secure request to OpenAI API image generator.

As an example, we will be using the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create?lang=curl) image generator from Skapi.

We will referencing the OpenAI API documentation to understand how to make secure requests to the API.

#### Prerequisites

1. Create an OpenAI account and get your API secret key from [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. Save your OpenAI API secret key in your service dashboard.
   For more information on how to save the client secret key, see [Client Secret Key](/service-settings/service-settings.html#client-secret-key). For this example save your OpenAI API key in the key name `openai`.
   We will use this key name when making the secure request to the OpenAI API.

#### Understanding the API call

In the API documentation, we can see that the API call is made as follows:

```
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations
```

This means the API call should be made using the `POST` method to the `https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations` URL.

Next, you will see curl example of the API call:

``` bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "dall-e-3",
    "prompt": "A cute baby sea otter",
    "n": 1,
    "size": "1024x1024"
  }'
```

This means the API call to `https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations` should be made with a `header` with `Content-Type` to `application/json` and `Authorization` to `Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY`.
And the post data should contain properties like `model`, `prompt`, `n`, and `size`.

The `$OPENAI_API_KEY` is the API secret key that you have obtained from the OpenAI website. And it is meant to be replaced with your API secret key.

Since we cannot expose the API secret key in the frontend, we will be using the [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) method to make a secure request to the OpenAI API:

    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: 'Bearer $CLIENT_SECRET'
    },
    data: {
        model: "dall-e-3",
        "prompt": "A cute baby sea otter",
        n: 1,
        size: "1024x1024"
    }
})
```

The example above shows how we can compose the request headers and data to make a secure request to the OpenAI API.
Note that we have used the `$CLIENT_SECRET` placeholder string in the `Authorization` header value,
and we have set `clientSecretName` to `openai` which is the key name that you may have saved your OpenAI API key in the service dashboard.

When the request is made, Skapi will replace the placeholder string with the client secret key that you have saved in your service dashboard, and return the response from the OpenAI API.<br><br># E-Mail Service

Skapi provides three very convenient email services:

- **Automated Emails**: Send automated emails to your users.

    When user signs up, or when user forgets their password, gets invited to your service, or needs a welcome email to be sent, you can use Skapi's automated email service to setup your email templates and send emails to your users.

- **Bulk Email Service**: Send bulk emails to your users.
  
    Skapi provides a built-in E-Mail service that allows you to send bulk emails to your users.
    You can immediately collect email addresses from your users, and send newsletters using Skapi's E-Mail service.

- **Receiving Inquiries**: Receive inquiries from your users.

    Skapi provides a built-in E-Mail service that allows you to receive inquiries from your users.
    You can immediately receive inquiries from your visitors, using Skapi's E-Mail service.

In this section, you will learn how to setup automated emails for your service, and how to send bulk emails to your users.<br><br># Automated E-Mail

When the user signup, reset password, or change email, subscribes to public newsletters, get invited to your service,
the system will send an automated email to the user.
You can customize the email template of the automated emails by sending your templates to the email endpoints.

E-Mail endpoints can be found in your `Automated Email` page in your Skapi admin page.

In the `Automated Email` page, select an email type you want to set the template.

- **Signup Confirmation**
  
  Endpoint for signup confirmation email template. The user receives this email when they are requested for confirmation on signup.

- **Welcome Email**
  
  Endpoint for welcome email template. The user receives this email when they signup, and have successfully verified their email, and logged in for the first time.

- **Verification Email**
  
  Endpoint for verification email template. The user receives this email when verifes their email or when they request the [`forgotPassword()`](/api-reference/authentication/README.md#forgotpassword).
  

- **Invitation Email**
  
  Endpoint for invitation email template. The user receives this email when they are invited to the service.
  You can send invitation to users from the `Users` page in your admin page in Skapi website.

<!-- - **Newsletter Subscription**
  
  Endpoint for public newsletter subscription confirmation email template. The user receives this email when they subscribe to the public newsletter. -->

Once you select the email type, the page will show the email endpoint address to set the template.
Following example shows the format for email endpoints:

```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@mail.skapi.com
```

To customize the email template, just send your customized template via your e-mail to the endpoint address.

:::danger
- **DO NOT** share your email endpoint address with anyone. This endpoint is unique to your service and should be kept private.
- You must use the same email address that you used to signup to Skapi.
:::

## Template Placeholders

E-Mail templates takes custom placeholders that can be used to customize the email template.
If there is a placeholder character in your email content, it will be replaced with the corresponding value.

- **`${service_name}`**: Name of your service.
- **`${name}`**: User's name from the profile. If the user has not set their name, it will be replaced with empty string.
- **`${email}`**: User's email address.

## Required Placeholders for signup confirmation email

When sending signup confirmation email, you must include set a link with **`https://link.skapi`** as a url in your email content.
The dummy url **`https://link.skapi`** will be replaced with the actual link that confirms the user's signup.

Example below shows how to set the link with **`https://link.skapi`** url in gmail.
Any other email service should have similar way to set the link.

![gmail link](/linkexam.png)

Below shows an example of signup confirmation template. In this example we included **`${service_name}`** in the subject, and **`${name}`** with link in the content.

![signup confirmation template](/conftempexamp.png)


## Required Placeholders for verification email

When sending verification email, you must include **`${code}`** placeholders in your email content.

:::tip
To make the invitation email more personal, it would be good idea to include **`${name}`** placeholder in the template.
:::

<!-- ## Required Placeholders for public newsletter subscription confirmation email

When user subscribes to your public newsletters user receives subscription confirmation email.
The subscription confirmation email contains a link to confirm the subscription.

you must include **`https://link.skapi`** placeholders in your email content. -->
<br><br># Bulk Email

You can send newsletters or service mail to your users by sending your email to the endpoint email address.
The following example shows the format for email endpoints for sending newsletters:

```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@mail.skapi.com
```

Go to `Bulk Email` page, select the email type, and the page will show the email endpoint address to send the newsletter.

## Sending Public Newsletters

You can send public newsletters to your users by sending your email to the endpoint email.

First, the users must subscribe to the public newsletter to receive your public newsletters:

:::code-group
```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.subscribeNewsletter(event).then(res => alert(res))">
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder='your@email.com'/>
    <input hidden name="redirect" value="https://your.domain.com/successpage"/>
    <input hidden name="group" value="public"/>
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"/>
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.subscribeNewsletter({
    email: 'users@email.com',
    redirect: 'https://your.domain.com/successpage',
    group: 'public'
}).then(res => alert(res));
```
:::

The example above shows how to let your visitors subscribe to the public newsletter by calling [`subscribeNewsletter()`](/api-reference/email/README.md#subscribenewsletter).

When the request is successful, user will receive a confirmation email to verify their email address.
User can confirm their email address by clicking the link in the email.
If the confirmation is successful, the user will be redirected to the redirect url provided in the [`subscribeNewsletter()`](/api-reference/email/README.md#subscribenewsletter) parameter.

All the public newsletters will have unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.
When the user clicks the unsubscribe link, they will no longer receive your public newsletters.

For more detailed information on all the parameters and options available with the [`subscribeNewsletter()`](/api-reference/email/README.md#subscribenewsletter) method, 
please refer to the API Reference below:

### [`subscribeNewsletter(params, callbacks):Promise<string>`](/api-reference/email/README.md#subscribenewsletter)

:::warning
If the user is logged in, they will not be asked to confirm their email address.
Instead, they must have their [`email verifed`](/user-account/email-verification).
:::

## Sending Service Mail
  
You can send service mail to your users with an account. To subscribe to service mails the user must be logged in.
Service mail can be useful to send information, notifications, and other service-related emails.

First, user must subscribe to the service newsletter to receive the email.

:::warning
- User must be logged in to subscribe to your service newsletters.
- User must have their email verified to subscribe to your service newsletters.
:::

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.subscribeNewsletter(event).then(res => alert(res))">
    <input hidden name="group" value="authorized"/>
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"/>
</form>
```

```js [JS]
skapi.subscribeNewsletter({
    group: 'authorized'
}).then(res => alert(res));
```
:::

The example above shows how to let your visitors subscribe to the service mail by calling [`subscribeNewsletter()`](/api-reference/email/README.md#subscribenewsletter).

## Requesting Newsletter Endpoint for Admins

The [`adminNewsletterRequest()`](/api-reference/email/README.html#adminnewsletterrequest) method allows administrators to request a personalized email endpoint for sending newsletters. Only users with administrator privileges (access group 99) can request this endpoint.

To send newsletters, an admin must first request a personalized endpoint using [`adminNewsletterRequest()`](/api-reference/email/README.html#adminnewsletterrequest). This method verifies admin privileges and returns a unique URL for sending emails.

```js [JS]
skapi.adminNewsletterRequest().then(response => {
    console.log("Your newsletter endpoint:", response)});
```

:::warning
This endpoint is specific to the requesting admin and can only receive emails from the admin’s registered email address.
:::

## Checking if the user is subscribed to the service mail

You can let the user check if they have subscribed to the service mail by calling [`getNewsletterSubscription()`](/api-reference/email/README.md#getnewslettersubscription).

```js
skapi.getNewsletterSubscription({
    group: 'authorized'
}).then(subs => {
    if (subs.length) {
        // user is subscribed to the service newsletter
    }
    else {
        // no subscription
    }
})
```

## Unsubscribing from the service mail

You can let the user unsubscribe from the service newsletter by calling [`unsubscribeNewsletter()`](/api-reference/email/README.md#unsubscribenewsletter).

```js
skapi.unsubscribeNewsletter({
    group: 'authorized'
}).then(res => {
    // user is unsubscribed from the service newsletter
})
```

## Fetching Sent Emails

You can fetch sent emails from the database by calling [`getNewsletters()`](/api-reference/email/README.md#getnewsletters).
By default, it fetches all the public newsletters from the database in descending timestamp.

In the newsletter object, the `url` is the URL of the html file of the newsletter. You can use the URL to fetch the newsletter content.

```js
skapi.getNewsletters().then(newsletters => {
    // newsletters.list is an array of newsletters
    /*
    {
        message_id: string; // Message ID of the newsletter
        timestamp: number; // Timestamp of the newsletter
        complaint: number; // Number of complaints
        read: number; // Number of reads
        subject: string; // Subject of the newsletter
